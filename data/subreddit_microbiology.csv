24,"Hey /r/microbiology, I made a Research Paper recommender for MedLine papers, check it out. Easy to run in Google Colaboratory","I made a research paper recommender MedLine papers, try it out! It uses embeddings to represent each paper, so you can get TSNE maps of the recommended papers, recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations for that combo of several papers.

###What is it?

The dataset used is Semantic Scholar's corpus of research paper (https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/ ), and was trained by a Word2Vec-based algorithm to develop an embedding for each paper. The database contains over 2 million papers from MedLine. You can put 1 or more (as many as you want) papers and the recommender will return the most similar papers to those papers. You can also make TSNE maps of those recommendations. 

https://i.imgur.com/B4qdoCC.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/OCgp0MV.jpg

###Where is it?

Github

https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/MedLineResearch2VecPublicPlayGroundV2.ipynb

Or direct look to Google Colab

https://colab.research.google.com/github/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/MedLineResearch2VecPublicPlayGroundV2.ipynb

###What can you do with it ?

You can input a paper, and see what are the most similar papers to it, though the first 30-80 will most likely be papers it has cited or was cited by. I've set it to return 300 papers but it ranks all 1,666,577 papers so you can set it to return whatever number of papers you want without any change in performance (except when it comes to developing the TSNE maps)

Now, the fun part: utilization the embedding properties:

You can see a TSNE map of how those similar papers are related to each other. The TSNE takes a while to process for 500 points (10-20 minutes). You can decrease the number of papers for a speedup, or increase the number of papers but that'll take more time.

You can input several papers by adding the embeddings, and get recommendations for combined papers, just add the embeddings for all the papers (you don't have to average them since the embeddings are normalized ). 

Finally, my favorite part, you can get TSNE maps of the recommendations for the combined papers are well. 

**A great use case would be if you're writing a paper, or plan to do some research and would like to check if someone has already done something similar. You can input all the papers you cited or would like to cite, and look over the recommendations.** 

### How important is this ?

When I was in R&amp;D, we spent a lot of time reinventing the wheel; a lot of techniques, methods, and processes that we developed were already pioneered or likely pioneered. But we weren't able to look for them, mainly due to not hitting the right keyword/phrasing in our queries.

There's a lot of variation in terms which can make finding papers for a particular concept very tricky at times.

I've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented very similar concepts in a previous paper.

Even the Google Brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. A few months ago they released a paper of Swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it.

&gt; ""As has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. The fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough &gt;enough literature search. My sincere apologies. We will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.""

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/dojjag2/

So if this is something that happens to the Google Brain team, not being able to find all papers on a particular topic is something all people are prone too.

Here's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept.

Word2Bits - Quantized Word Vectors

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05651

Binary Latent Representations for Efficient Ranking: Empirical Assessment

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07479

Exact same concept, but two very different ways of descriptions and terminology.

###How do I use it ?

Here's a quick video demonstration:

https://youtu.be/Y-O0wbsg_kY

I tried to make this user friendly and as fast to figure out and run as possible, but there's probably stuff I didn't take into account. Let me know of you have any questions on how to run it or any feedback. If you want, you can just give me what papers you want to analyze and I'll do it for you (look up the papers on https://www.semanticscholar.org/ first )

Here's a step by step guide to help people get started

**Step 1:** 

Run the Section 1 of code in the Colab notebook. This will download the model and the dictionaries for the titles, Ids, and links. 

https://snag.gy/rmoCXO.jpg

**Step 2:**

Find the papers want to find similar papers for at Semantic Scholar https://www.semanticscholar.org

Get either the title or Semantic Scholar's paperID, which is the last section of numbers/letters in the link. For example, in this link

https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Distributed-Representations-of-Sentences-and-Le-Mikolov/9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3

The Semantic Scholar paper ID is '9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3'

Use the title(s) and/or Semantic Scholar's paperID(s) with Section 2 and Section 3 to get the EmbedID from the model. EmbedIDs are how the model keeps track of each paper (not the paperID). 

https://i.imgur.com/0yAQEZl.jpg

The EmbedID is what each dictionary first returns. 

**Step 3:**

In Section 4, insert the EmbedID(s) as the values of paper1EmbedID, paper2EmbedID, paper3EmbedID, paper4EmbedID, etc. 

https://snag.gy/AzeP91.jpg

If you have less than or more than 4 papers you want to analyze, change these lines 

    extracted_v = paper1 + paper2 #+ paper3 + paper4  #Don't need to average since vectors are normalized 
    extracted_vSM = paper1SM #+ paper2SM + paper3SM + paper4SM  #Don't need to average since vectors are normalized 

and create or eliminate the lines of code for vector extraction

    paper1 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper2 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) 
    paper3 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper4 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) 
    
    paper1SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper2SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) 
    paper3SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper4SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) 

Finally, run Section 5 to get a TSNE map of the recommendations. With 300 papers, it takes 15-18 minutes for the map to be produced. 

**Ask any question you have no matter how minor, I want people to use this as quickly as possible with as little time as possible figuring out what to do.** 

### Other details

So it probably doesn't have any papers released in the last 5 months; I think the corpus was last updated in March 2018. Due to the limitation on my computational resources (Google Colab) I had to filter towards more papers with more connections to other papers in the database. A connection is either a citation to another paper in the database, or cited by another paper in the database. I filtered to only include papers with 50 or more connections because Colab would crash if I tried to include more. 

As of right now, the recommender has 2,096,359 papers. I hope to make future versions with more many more papers, including papers from other fields. 

### Feedback greatly appreciated !

I am hoping to get as much feedback as possible. I am specifically looking for cases where you feel that the recommender should have given a particular paper in the top results, but didn't. I am hoping to make an evaluation toolkit that I can use to tune the hyperparameters.

53,Weird floaties in homemade vanilla extract,"Hi everyone! 
Hopefully this is the right place to post this (I’m not a microbiology person), so let me know if it’s not and I can take it down. 

I have been making my own vanilla extract for probably 8 years. I have never had a problem until last year. I made a big batch of vanilla with about ten or 12 pods with dark rum as my base, and then a couple weeks later, went on holiday for three months. 

When I came back, there were blotches of yellow stuff floating on the top and at the sides of the top. (The blotches looked just like how pollen forms if left on water, and is the same color as pollen.) I left it for a year to see what it did and there is no more of this yellow stuff on top than there was after I came back from the first holiday. 

I decided yesterday to wipe it off the sides and off the top to see if it comes back in a month, but I am an idiot and didn’t take a picture. 

Does anyone know of a fungus or bacteria that can survive on the surface of alcohol for a year? I don’t know exactly what brand of rum I used but it’s going to at least be 35-40% ABV. Or could it actually be pollen? Orchids do have to be hand pollinated, so maybe there is a bunch of pollen floating about in the grow process? 

I’ve absolutely scoured the internet and haven’t seen anything remotely like it. 

Anyway, just curious if any microbiologists/food microbiologists might have any ideas of whether this is safe or not. I hate to throw it away, because if I were to try to buy that much vanilla from the store it would be like a hundred bucks and it’s never as good!!

I am studying microbiology as part of my veterinary degree and preparing for an open book exam. There are some things in the book we are allowed to bring that I don't understand.

Can I just confirm that this is just that they create pili with a different antigenic makeup so that the immune system no longer recognises them but they can still perform functions with the pili?

Dysfunctions of melatonin production and regulation could lead to depression and schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, as well as fibromyalgia.

Doping, one of the biggest issues in competitive sport, still remains an ongoing problem. Sadly, the fight against doping is presently quite inefficient. It is complicated by new doping methods such as gene doping that are very difficult to detect. 

The effectiveness of anti-doping measures greatly depends on the athletes’ perception. So, 42 German cyclists and 104 track and field athletes were asked about doping, and they perceive improved detection and diagnostics as the most important anti-doping method, followed by increased bans. All in all, it is hoped that this insight will contribute to the implementation of future anti-doping laws.

192,Help for someone considering changing majors,Hello I'm currently a first year materials engineering student that is looking to switch out. I dont think I want to be an engineer and I'm looking to focus more on research and the biochem side of science rather than physics and chemistry.I have always kind of thought that since I like math and science I had to be an engineer but I have come to see that that isnt true and there is a big difference between being an engineer and doing research. I have been considering a dual major in microbiology and genetics because I have always enjoyed reading and learning about genetics as a passion. My school does offer a dual major program for people interested in microbiology and genetics I was interested in hearing about what people in the field think of this idea and any job positions that are opened up by this pairing rather than just studying one or the other. Is this something worth spending the time on? Any feedback or advice would be appreciated. Thank you.,microbiology,1540358359,CrookedFish,10,1,True,2018-10-24

200,Resurrection of kick-ass 450 million-years-old enzymes,"https://i.redd.it/7fvhe2ufdau11.jpg

450 million-years-old enzymes have been recreated in the lab and they kick ass. These enzymes can sustain higher temperatures, which makes them ideal robust biocatalysts… and they seem to perform better than their current counterparts. Check out the Nature article at: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-018-0159-5/](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-018-0159-5/) 

Let’s have a closer look: the Precambrian-era ketol-acid reductoisomerase for instance showed higher activity than its counterpart from *E. coli*. This is great news for biofuel production but also for the production of other desired chemicals. Utilisation of ancient enzymes could translate to cheaper production of chemicals and that at scale. 

But how did the researchers come up with the ancient enzyme? They used a computational technique named ancestral sequence reconstruction and inferred the most probable amino acid sequence of the enzyme that could have existed in the first vertebrates. In fact, they inferred a population of possible ancestral enzymes. Then the amino acid sequences were reverse translated into genes that were introduced into bacteria and tested for their properties. 

This process requires a lot of gene synthesis, which can be quite time consuming. Eurofins Genomics provides synthetic genes in high quality and that ultra-fast – in less than 48 hours.

201,Help for someone new to the topic and struggling,"I am currently taking my first (and trust me, only) micro class ever.

This is the last pre req I need to apply for our nursing program, and I have aced all of the other sciences. I got my grade from our last exam last night- a big fat D. 

He had a bit of a blowup in class the other day that seemed to be directed at me, in regards to how hard this class is supposed to be, and if we can’t survive this then how do we expect to survive the program? He wasn’t wrong, but, also got angry over the fact that I asked him an honest question. All in all, what I’m saying here, is he is not considered a resource.

He claims he tests straight out of our notes, and i study them with all of my might but nothing sticks. I’m a very visual person, I rewrite all of the notes in different colors and fonts so that hopefully I’ll be able to recollect them a little more- a tactic that has earned me a’s until now, the A’s I need for the program application.

202,The elegant way to use CRISPR: Base Editing – Free Read of this Nature Review for one month,"Point mutations are the largest type of pathogenic mutations in humans. Reversing or introducing pathogenic point mutations is of great interest for the treatment of many genetic disorders. The popular CRISPR/Cas9 is mostly undesired for working with point mutations since it introduces double strand breaks. With modifications, however, editing point mutations is possible.    

Let’s have a closer look: Deactivated Cas nuclease fused to a nucleobase deaminase can be used to directly introduce point mutations into DNA and RNA, and this without double-strand breaks. These Base Editors effectively convert one base or base pair into another by deamination (C-G to a T-A).

204,Question about antibiotic susceptibility,"Hi all.  I'm an optometrist looking into antibiotics and I'm trying to make myself a cheat sheet for useful antibiotics for given bacteria and fungi.  If an infection is serious enough that I need to get a culture, I'll probably get a sensitivity too.  But some things are more common.  Like if a patient mis-wears their contact lenses, the most common bacterial infection is Pseudomonas.

&amp;#x200B;

So I think I understand the standards for sensitive, intermediate, and resistant but I just wanna check my understanding first.  Say, for a particular isolate of S. aureus, you test for sensitivity and find that the penicillin MIC is &lt;xyz&gt;, which is higher than Penicillin's clinical breakpoint for sensitive, but less than the breakpoint for resistant (so this one has intermediate sensitivity to penicillin).  Clinical breakpoints are the concentrations for an antibiotic which are calculated based on that antibiotic's pharmacokinetics and side effect profile.  So the breakpoint for sensitive is a generally safe dose of pencillin.  Intermediate would mean that the MIC for this strain of S. aureus is kinda high so you're going to have to deal with a fair amount of side effects if you want to dose high enough to actually inhibit growth.

&amp;#x200B;

Epidemiological cutoff values are more based on wild type and acquired resistances for a strain of bacteria to particular antibiotics.  If a given isolate is tested and has a MIC of &lt;xyz&gt; for tetracyline, which is higher than the ECV, then it is more likely that this isolate has an acquired resistance for tetracycline and is in the second ""hump"" of the bimodal distribution of MICs.  So these are more useful for epidemiologists tracking antibiotic resistance than for me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming I understand those concepts correctly, my question is about populations of bacteria (and treating empirically).  Let's say you take 500 isolates of P. aeruginosa.   You test antibiotic susceptibility and calculate what percentage are sensitive/intermediate/resistant to ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, gentamicin, etc.  Obviously if I found 98% of the 500 isolates were sensitive to vancomycin, that would be great!  I would say P. aeruginosa is generally pretty susceptible to vancomycin.  But is there a formal system for categorizing susceptibility?  Like if &gt;80% of isolates are sensitive to antibiotic X that means good susceptibility, while 60-80% sensitive to antibiotic Y means moderate susceptibility?  So if I have a contact lens related bacterial infection, I can look at various antibiotics and say ofloxacin has ""good"" susceptibility to P aeruginosa.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that the FDA package inserts list susceptible bacteria but I'm looking to gather info from journal papers that look at some of the rarer organisms and want to make notes on susceptibility for those.

&amp;#x200B;

I did read a bit about the 90/60 rule and am wondering if this is what I'm looking for?  However, given the rarity of certain ophthalmic infections and the subsequent rarity of studies examining antibiotic susceptibility, I'm not sure &gt;90% would be a good cutoff value.",microbiology,1540585606,Jason_Webb,8,1,True,2018-10-26

*Processing img dv4md04v1cv11...*

**Hold on! I need to feed my musical instrument.**

Ever wondered what yeast, paramecia and moss sound like? Wonder no more. Here is the answer. The “paramecia controller” is played by an electric field that influences the movement of the single-cell microorganisms in liquid medium. This movement is then translated into sound. The “yeast organ” produces sounds through fermentation. The generated bubbles in the conical flask give a jazzy feeling to the music. It’s all combined in a very complex soundscape, which may sound a little weird in the beginning but check it out for yourself: [https://vimeo.com/155704177](https://vimeo.com/155704177) 

Here is a video of the “mossphone”: [https://vimeo.com/155696946](https://vimeo.com/155696946). It is played by hand movement that changes the electromagnetic field of the moss. These changes are then translated into sound. 

However, these “living instrument” cannot be controlled entirely. They live and have their own behaviour, so the musicians need to improvise every time they play these “living instruments”.",microbiology,1540909656,genomics-expert,0,1,True,2018-10-30

256,Thinking of majoring in micro,"Hey everyone, looking for some input.

I am going back to school after being in the cannabis industry most of my adult life. I have never been to college so I am wading through ideas of the best route of study. I have been planning on studying microbiology, and I still think this is the best plan, I just wanted your opinion if there may be a better fit?

Soil microbiology and compost teas are what originally sparked my interest in microbiology. I hope to do consulting work in the private sector doing soil and compost tea analysis, though friends tell me there is work in tissue culture testing in the labs as well. I also was thinking about trying to work for a nutrient company. I really want to learn and spread knowledge about how to feed and produce all of our crops more environmentally consciously. 

The school I will be attending has other degrees in Soil science in the agricultural college, as well as things like Botany and Plant Pathology. I also feel like Biochemistry or Molecular Biology could be a good route as well.

My fear is that microbiology could be too medically focused (although my school separates the micro department into traditional micro and biohealth for pre med. It seems like there are a lot of micro classes I will enjoy) or too broad to really have focus in my attempted goals. On the plus side I hope to do some  cool research (a microbiologist saved humanity from extinction in 1992 and the EPA swept it under the rug and tried to keep him from getting his PhD). The downside is I have read the job outlook isn't great, and I'm not sure yet how much I will enjoy the medical side of the degree. 

Dr. Elaine Ingham's work is what really inspired me to go get a degree studying this stuff. She is a PhD microbiologist with an emphasis on soil. When she was on faculty at the school I will attend, she worked in the Forestry and Botany and Plant Pathology departments 

I love the idea of microbiology, I will be starting school soon. I have some time to make a decision;  Basically between micro, biochem, molbio, soil science, and botany and plant pathology.

I still need to do a lot more research on all my options, but I am officially starting my journey back to school and registering for my first classes this week. Hoping to get some opinions

TL;DR: how would viral shift look different than viral shift on a Southern Blot?

I’m trying to determine whether or not it is possible to determine whether a virus has undergone a genetic shift or genetic drift using Southern Blotting. If it is distinguishable what would the gel look like? 

We are given that the entering  viruses have three RNA strands. One virus has red RNA and the other has blue RNA. Along with reverse transcriptase we are also given restriction enzymes, DNA pol, and ligase. 

I know that drift would lead to a point mutation so the exiting viruses would have the “same” RNA coming out (just with the point mutation). 

In the case of shift the RNA would get all mixed up so an exiting virus would have both blue and red RNA. 

I just can’t figure out how that would affect PCR though. ",microbiology,1541634629,ardentlyarden,3,1,True,2018-11-07

Normally I shred my leaves and mix in greens to help them decompose faster. This year I got si many leaves, I dont have time to shred them, so in the swales they go.

Now my question...

On the downhill side of the swale is a berm, a 2 feet tall, 5 foot wide hill. Trees and bushes are planted in this berm.

Considering leaves mat really hard when they aren't shredded they will make the entire leaf pile anaerobic. It may take 2 years to break down finally. Am I risking creating an anaerobic spawning ground that will hurt my trees? Or can they handle it?

On a similar note, I put leaves 2-3 feet thick at the back of my land. There's no food trees there but a bunch of ash and maple. Will those be okay with 3 feet of unshredded leaves around them? I pulled back a clear area 3 inches around the trunk to help prevent boring insects.

I plan to get certified through an MS program for CLS and then take the ASCP exam so that I can get my license.

As of now, I have taken a lot of different courses in the meantime--biology, biochemistry, calculus, genetics, immunology, several different microbiology classes, organic chemistry, etc. and have a considerable amount of research experience, though not in a medical lab. I also work a job as a biology/math tutor.

Before I graduate, I was thinking about taking a course in biochemical techniques, since I have not taken any analytical chemistry. I want to get a job straight out of college and I have lab experience, but I am not as proficient in some of the techniques as I'd like to be. I was wondering how important it would be for me to take a class that trains me in these areas, so that I can get my start in a lab conducting research after my graduation.

The thing that is most important to me as a CLS is that I am able to specialize in microbiology, and get certified as an SM in addition to a CLS.

The class covers the following techniques, all while studying a single enzyme from a species of Streptomyces:

\- Plasmid Purification and Restriction Analysis

\- Site-Directed Mutagenesis

\- Protein Purification

\- Enzyme Kinetics and Protein Folding

\- Mass Spectrometry

\- Scientific Writing

If someone could give me some advice on the techniques I'd need to know before getting a job, that would be great.

**GRAM-NEGATIVE RESULTS**

For the gram-negative testing, a tube of TSI, Citrate, and Urea agar were inoculated with the bacterium. Results were questionable, because the TSI tube had a red alkaline slant, and yellow butt indicating only Glucose fermentation, but there was also gas formation on the bottom of the tube but no black which indicated no hydrogen sulfide production. This made it hard to determine what the G- bacteria was, my first conclusion was Alcaligenes faecalis (yellow butt, red slant) but since there was gas production, I had to choose between Enterobacter aerogenes (it was Citrate+) or Salmonella typhimurium which is (H2s+ and Urea-).

I'm wondering what this could be. My first guess was that this was a mutation or adaptation that popped up in something that would otherwise not go through aluminium since if it was something from a prior contamination the stuff would more widespread and happen a lot more often than it does.

Like I said, I'm curious and like learning so I'm looking to test this stuff to know as much as possible about it and I'm looking for ideas to figure this thing out. My first idea is to get aluminium foil and put it over the holes to see if the stuff goes through it too. If it does I'd then take the piece of foil and wrap it in more foil and do this a few more times if it goes through again to figure out if the bacteria/fungus feeds on the aluminium or if the corrosion is a byproduct of some other process.

Any insight or ideas for other tests?",microbiology,1542911112,ygdrad,4,1,True,2018-11-22

Based on the Gram stain being pink (I know it's hard to tell based on the photo, but with proper light intensity it is) and the isolated bacteria growing on HEA and EMB, I believe it to be Gram-negative. 

When it comes to morphology however, I'm on the fence whether I should classify it as cocci or bacillus. The majority of the specimens appear to be cocci, but a number of them also appear to be coccobacillus. I can't tell if some of the ones I believe to be coccobacilli are actually instead diplococci, or if it's just the bad resolution. If they were diplococci, that would indeed help my case for the unknown being Neisseria.

I’ll be cut and swift to the point about this thread: I’m very scared I won’t get a job in my field and work at a job that’ll make me kill my self or do get a job in microbiology but it’s piss poor paying

I would like to go into microbiology since I love science a lot. I’m not a money hungry person, if I was I would be a math major kid and call it a damn day.

I love the environment and focusing my attention on bacteria and fungus and I would love to work in that but it doesn’t seem to be many jobs (mind you I did a quick google search and nothing more — I checked Glassdoor and the other stuff but not anything else ) anywho, I noticed many jobs that are to entry levels are jobs related to the hospital; which I’m ok with!

However, I saw most require an ASCP? I’m not sure what that is exactly, and I don’t want to go into micro medicine school at my university since my tuition for a scholar microbiologist would be $5 ,000 per semester to maybe $7 or double plus more school work. Can I get ASCP through the actual board ? I don’t plan on getting my MS anytime soon, and again I don’t mind making $40k and up per year as my start (I’m content with that since I’ve come from a very poor household) 

Would this be a positive path?
Is it even possible?
Is there a high demand?
Should I look for other careers?

396,Just told my mom that I'm going to switch to Microbiology..... How do I deal with angry family members?,"I'm currently a freshman in a Biosystems/AgE program at a major research oriented university, but I cannot see myself going into this career at all. I have literally hated everything I have heard that BE grads do when they graduate. (and I have spoken to BE alums from my program that had 6 months of industry experience-30 years. it all sounds awful.) I'm growing sicker and sicker of this everyday. 

I knew that Biology was my passion since I was a 12 year old kid. My science teachers while I was in middle school always told me that I belonged in science. I always had a natural curiosity as to how the world worked, but I got really sick at this age and spent a lot of time trying to learn what was wrong with me. The information just clicked so easily and intrigued me. By the time high school rolled around, it was clear academically that I belonged in this field and my interest remained. 

I thought I would be going into microbiology throughout my whole time in high school, but when college admissions rolled around I chickened out and put Biosystems on my app because the job prospects and low salaries scared me. Now I am regretting this. I talked to the career adviser for engineering and she encouraged me to stay just so that I can have ""engineer"" behind my name, but the adviser in the college of natural science (who worked 20 years in a wet lab) told me that I'd be better trained to work my dream jobs with an MMG degree + a lot of lab experience during undergrad. I'm not really sure which side of the field I want to work in; pharma, water testing, food/ag, government jobs, biotech/genetic engineering, forensic biology, and cosmetics all sound fine. 

I'm a first generation college student in my family and there's a lot of pressure on me to escape the dead-end middle class jobs that they work. I've been told since the time I could walk that I was going to go to college, make a great living, not have to work 100 hour weeks, and spend time with my family. This has been beaten so hard into my head, so I don't want to let anybody down. I tried to tell my dad first that I was going to switch, he told me that I need to have an adult job when I leave and not fuck around in a lab with a shit salary. All of my grandparents didn't take me seriously and told me to look into other majors. 

My mom literally screamed at me. She told me to go be a ditchdigger, get the hell out of that university, and started cursing me out. She told me don't ask for my help when you are drowning in student loan debt and to get a second job after graduating. She said who cares if you like what you do, biologists make shitty salaries and you need to be able to make a living. Then she went on about how she doesn't love her job all the time and I said well you don't hate everyday of it then she yelled at me some more about how I shouldn't tell her how she feels. 

This is upsetting me because I AM worried about job prospects. I AM worried about making ends meet. (My family members all make around 70k without college educations.) I want them to take my goals seriously and for them not to be so pissed at me. I've put a lot of years into this subject and I honestly feel super insulted right now.

I'm interested in microbiology and am going on a research trip to the Caribbean in a few months, for which I can choose any research project that is realistic for a 10-day timeframe. I took a similar trip last year, but had much less freedom; it was more focused on species identification and basic water sampling techniques. My question is this: Is there any way I can study marine microorganisms in a simple, yet still meaningful way over the course of a week?  I am familiar with basic staining and culturing techniques and plate/slide enumeration. I'm all too aware that culturing marine microbes is notoriously difficult and time-consuming. All of my ideas thus far are way, way too big-picture for what I can realistically do as an undergrad at a remote field station. I'm just starting to feel really discouraged and naïve.

In the manual, it states that the wells are in groups of 4 due to the arrangement of electrodes [seen here](https://imgur.com/a/pUlEkVB). 
&gt;The 16 wells within E-Plate 16 are organized in such a way that each column of
8 wells is divided into two 4-well groups. To achieve consistent and accurate data
during the experiment it is necessary to use the wells within a group in the same
experiment. Examples of such 4-well groups are: A1, B1, C1 and D1 as a group;
E3, F3, G3 and H3 as a group, etc.

This is a quote from the user manual. I don't fully understand what this means. Does it mean that my replicates should all be in the same group?

450,Can the fungus responsible for athletes foot survive in a solution of water and apple cider vinegar?,"I recently discovered that I had athletes foot and one of the popular consensus on the internet seemed to be to soak the infected foot in a solution of 50/50 water and apple cider and vinegar. 

I have been doing that for about 6 weeks so far, and there are only some small areas left in which there seems to be that dry flaking skin, although the areas such as between my toes and on top of my toes have made great recovery and show no signs of infection.

The method I've been doing is putting the solution in a container that is about the size of a shoe box and soaking the infected foot once a day for 30-45 minutes, although I don't dispose and replace the solution for about a week. 

My questions for r/microbiology are:

Could the fungus responsible for the infection be living in the container? 

I took microbiology in college and my professor did mention in several instance that treating a fungal infection can take a long time, how much truth is there behind it?

While these next three may be best to see a doctor for, but it doesn't hurt to ask anyway:

Can fungus and/or its spores actually live in socks even though they've been washed? Would this mean that they could also linger on other linen and carpeted areas?

The reason for not creating a new solution every day is to help reduce cost, if I should be replacing the solution every treatment are there any other less expensive solutions?

Are OTC ointments worth the money to put a nail in the coffin for the infection?

Once I see very minimal signs of infection I plan to buy new socks and wear those new socks while I continue the treatment. As of now the only symptoms I'm experience is mildly dry and flaking skin around areas 3, 4, and 8 based on this diagram.

451,CRISPR vs Peptide-based nucleic acid gene editing,"So I have been tasked with an assignment discussing whether CRISPR-Cas9 technology is more or less of a threat than peptide-based nucleic acid genomic modification (PNA) for nefarious purposes - i.e. genetically engineering biological agents for use by a terrorist organization or similar. But can someone help explain the difference between these two technologies?

&amp;#x200B;

While there are plenty of sources discussing and breaking down CRISPR technology, can anyone explain   
PNA to me as if I was a child? Or link me a source that does so? I don't know if my brain is just fried from finals but I am confused between the two... From my understanding, PNA is a molecular structure similar to DNA that can be used to find and replace specific segments of DNA.  Whereas, in a basic sense, CRISPR-cas9 splices DNA segments and can replace specific nucleobases turning on, off, or altering genetic function.  CRISPR seems more affordable and less technical but also less accurate, is this accurate?

For some background, I have always been interested in pursuing my PhD after receiving my [B.Sc](https://B.Sc) in Microbiology.  I choose to start in a lab pretty early (2nd semester freshmen year) and have remained there since. I have been fairly productive in the lab and will ideally have 3 publications (co-author) by the time I graduate (or shortly there after). I have also been lucky and was able to intern 10 weeks over a summer at a large government agency (hint: they fly rockets) where I was able to work on a independent project. I feel this is pretty good in terms of research experience and don't have many concerns in this area. 

My concerns regard my low GPA. I will graduate with roughly a 3.2 GPA from the large state university I attend. I was not really overly concerned about this until recently. My recent concern stems from my friends discussions about their applications to PhD programs. They are worried about their grades (which are certainly higher than mine) affecting their admission. I have been feeling recently that I may have underestimated how much GPA factors into admission into a PhD program and wanted to hear others opinions on the matter. Would my lower GPA jeopardize admission to competitive PhD programs, or is my research experience enough of a counter weight to my low GPA? Any and all advice and comments are welcome!

Our intro food science class retorted some spiced rice packages and we had 2 pouches fill up with gas, meaning some anaerobic bacterium was having a field day. I took a pouch and decided to perform a spore test because only a spore former could survive the retort conditions. It smells Stinky (the capital S is necessary) and sour. Definitely not C. botulinum, potentially a bacillus species. We thought maybe the retort didn't come up to temp and that a lactobacillus species was to blame. It smells sour like a cheese almost. After shocking the pouch for an hour in 80C water I stuck the pouch in the 4C until I could perform a serial dilution. Dilutions were plated on TSA and incubated 24 hrs at 35C either anaerobically or aerobically. There was no growth in the aerobic plate, but the anaerobic plates got a lot of growth. Colonies were round and opaque. We got a spreader on the plate I attached in the pic. Any idea what I've got?

My mentor is saying that I should look at the graph where Y = Absorbance (or Cells) and X = Time, and pick my data point from there. I think she's wrong and I need to make Y = (Ln of Absorbance) and X = time. I don't see how you can choose which double (aka, exponential growth) based on the slope of the linear form of the data. Am I right or wrong? If I'm wrong, why? What am I missing?

On top of that, when I do plot a graph where Y = (ln of absorbance), I do not see a lag phase at all. It is immediately at its highest growth rate, and proceeds to decrease until stationary phase. They essentially look like a [square-root graph](https://www.meta-calculator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/graph-of-cube-root-function.png). This makes it hard to pick the highest growth rate, because the higher the growth rate, the greater the inaccuracy. I tried to fix this by making lines-of-best-fit over 2, 3, 4 and 5 data points and only selecting lines where the R^2 value was greater than 0.95 to determine the highest growth rate.

But the question here is, how fast do these bacteria replicate in our gut when we consume for example 500 grams of probiotic yogurt? That equals approximately 5 billion bacteria which is a lot but almost nothing compared to trillions of native bacteria.

607,Teicoplanin as an alternative to Vancomycin,"I’m an undergrad in the US and i am about to embark on a research project in a laboratory on campus. I will be studying the effects of vancomycin on Akkermansia muciniphila and how it has been shown to increase expression of the Fxr gene (responsible for metabolism control in the liver) when it is treated with the antibiotic. Basically, I will be looking at how the microbe when treated with antibiotic increases expression of the gene thus promoting increased glucose metabolism. A. muciniphila is a prominent microbe which resides in the mucosa lining of the intestines of animals and low levels of it has been correlated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. 
I will also be studying what causes A. muciniphila to be resistant to vancomycin as a side project. 

Anyways... I came across Teicoplanin when researching vancomycins properties and such. It is noted that both are glycopeptide antibiotics and both have almost identical mechanisms of action against gram-positive bacteria (specifically MRSA, and enterococcal). 
I’m wondering if anyone has knowledge regarding Teicoplanin as I want to test to see if it induces increased expression of the gene like vancomycin does.

I'm looking for the best approach to fluorescently stain E. coli for observation under a microscope. Ideally this approach would stain all E. coli (independent of serotype) and no other species of bacteria (although I'm not sure how feasible this is). I should note that the bacteria will be fixed and permeabilized at the time of staining. So far I have tried the following fluorescently labelled antibodies:

They have all given negligible staining, even at the very high suggested concentrations (1:10 dilution, this seems very high to me). I have a feeling that these are questionable antibodies, since none of them have very good documentation of use cases.

It has been surprisingly difficult for me to find pan-e coli antibodies by Googling around. Perhaps this is because there isn't a good surface marker that is shared across e. coli strains but not other species?

I have started to investigate the idea of using phages, although I don't have a good understanding of how these compare to antibodies and the relative merits of each.

757,"Weird film in FTM sterility test- If it's not contamination, what is it?","Hi everyone! I am seeing a thin film/cloud on my FTM media that I'm 90% sure isn't microbe contamination, and here's why:

\-The cloud could be seen just a couple of hours after direct inoculation of my sample

\-I've used different brands of FTM media to inoculate the same sample without getting the same result

\-The cloud does not proliferate over time. The amount, turbidity, appearance, and everything else stays the same day after day of incubation.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the pictures aren't very telling, but that's just because that's how faint the cloud is. It's hard to tell, but its only about 2cm wide. The sample I'm testing is just in-house media, it does not contain any cells, DNA, or anything else....aka, the result I'm looking for should be identical to my negative control (FTM w/saline). It's as if my sample is having a chemical reaction to the FTM media....any other thoughts to what it could be? Has anyone else ever seen something similar to this?

758,Looking for some guidance,"I must start by apologising, in case this is not the correct subreddit to post.

I'm finishing sooner or later my PhD. Officially it's in Microbiology, although I do mostly biochemistry (protein purification, characterisation and the like). My microbiology lab is an environmental microbiology lab, and there's nothing even remotely associated with human health at all. 

However, I am increasingly realising since some time now that I would like to work with something related with pathogenic organisms. In particular, I have a fascination with sexually transmitted diseases, mostly those of bacterial origin. I would like to work in research, but there are a few caveats:

* During my PhD I discovered I'm not altogether suitable for the technical aspects of bench science. I do understand and can use several techniques, but I don't feel a particular fascination by it. I can purify proteins with ease, I know how to optimise a protocol and how to tackle difficulties, but this does not bring me particular joy. 
* I do like to compile information. I think I'm quite good at finding sources of information, at organising them, and at making conclusions out of it. I think that organisation and, humility aside, the ability to know lots of information are my best qualities
* I like epidemiology. I enjoy reading ECDC reports, I like to see statistics of diseases but, alas, I don't have a background in statistics. I'm not sure if I'd currently be able to start studying a new subject from scratch, but this is not completely out of the realm of possibilities
* Despite the first point, and even though I am not published (I got unlucky with my project, and also took too many projects without full consciousness of what I was doing... I was a sweet summer child straight from a masters), I think of myself as a capable research scientist. All this to say that a Post-doc is a possibility, and a quite strong one, **however**... I really would like to leave the environmental microbiology behind and focus more on pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, I don't think I want to pursue a Professorship. From what I've seen from Professors, there are way too many personal sacrifices I don't think I'm willing to make. This might be because I'm still in my mid-20s and single, and I don't really have the emotional support to be constantly changing places and in temporary contracts.

Taking all this, what really are my career options? Any advice would be welcome. DMs are also very welcome. 

As a side note... I'm willing to move countries once more, but I'm not willing to leave Europe for more than a few months. ",microbiology,1549482359,77to90,1,1,True,2019-02-06

My biggest concern is that when I'm new to a lab, and new to the information, I take a lot of joy in researching the new topics, getting acquainted with the lab techniques, and impressing my supervisors. After a few weeks/months, everything starts to become habit, and the novelty and energy dies out for the most part. I like looking for answers and conducting new experiments, but the repetition of experiments to get robust results kills me.

I am planning to take a year in Industry after my Bachelor's to get a feel for the working world, and I know my decision will have to be made within that year whether I want to work my way up in Industry, or get my PhD or Masters. Personally I don't know if I can handle academic research and how it's approached, and I think I would prefer the fast-paced work of Industry, but I can't make that comparison until I see for myself.

1. Nutrient broth allows us to observe the oxygen requirements for the growth of the microbe.  
2. Nutrient broth allows us to culture more microbe compared to the solid agar (volume wise)  


Are there other pertinent ones that I should know? 

Thinking about this because the saccharomyces cerevisiae that I cultured in nutrient broth grew while it did not grow at all on the nutrient agar. I read that it is a facultative anaerobe, which has greater growth in the presence of oxygen. Not sure if I'm right about this but wouldn't growing it on agar mean that it's exposed to a greater presence of oxygen since the agar is flat (..and not very thick?).

802,Performance Qualification of an Autoclave,"**TLDR** we are looking for resources on planning and executing a performance qualification (PQ) of an autoclave

Hello r/microbiology

We are a start up contract testing laboratory in Canada. We are still building out our lab and not yet testing production samples. We will primarily focus on testing Cannabis. From a microbiology perspective this will be plate based tests for total yeast and mold, total aerobic, coliforms and some specific organism tests. We are BSL-II certified.

My question is regarding performance qualification of an autoclave. We have found a great refurbished primus model from a reputable vendor. The autoclave will be used to:

* Decontaminate biosafety level II waste materials at a temp range between 121- 126C. We will use thermophile cultures as indicators to verify decontamination cycles.
* Media/Liquid cycle for solid and liquid media using glass containers such as flasks or bottles temp range between 121- 123C. Media will be subjected to sterility and growth promotion testing.
* Dry vacuum cycle for glassware and small equipment in autoclave pouches temp range between 121-123C.
* Bowie-Dick cycle.

Our microbiologist feels strongly about conducting an IQ OQ PQ program on the autoclave. He comes from a GLP lab previously that had a license to test pharmaceutical drugs although that lab was also doing cannabis testing in their pharma grade quality system as well. IQ OQ PQ and validation is a strict requirement for equipment such as an autoclave in an environment like this. There is no formal requirement for IQ OQ PQ of something like an autoclave set out in any of the Cannabis regulations in Canada presently. Our laboratory plans to seek ISO 17025 accreditation in the near term which also doesn't (?) place any formal requirements on IQ OQ PQ of a piece of equipment like an autoclave. Suffice to say that we are investigating this even though it doesn't seem to be a regulatory requirement for us presently.

The original manufacturer, Primus, is able to sell us an Instillation Qualification and Operational Qualification package at a reasonable price but we are having trouble with the performance qualification portion. Performance qualification of an autoclave is an involved process including worst-case assessment, cycle development and includes temperature mapping with validated data-logging probes. We only found one firm in town that was able to quote on a contract PQ program, a quote nearly 2x the cost of the autoclave of course. Their quote included them doing all the work as well as providing the protocol so we are seeing if simply buying the protocol and running ourselves might be cheaper. Conversations are on going. 

In the meantime we are wondering if anyone in the community has any resources, perhaps from Pharma or other highly regulated sectors, that maybe set guidelines on planning a PQ program for a piece of equipment like an autoclave?",microbiology,1550026774,la_racine,0,1,True,2019-02-12

There are cases where colonies are still quite distanced from each other but they’re too fine and quite a lot of them. They’re prolly still countable but somehow I‘m having difficulty remembering whether some colonies are already counted or not.

Any tips or techniques in counting? It would be very much appreciated. Thank you.",microbiology,1550208634,Meeresnymphe,14,1,True,2019-02-15

843,Microbiology textbook,"Good evening,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a third year medical student being implicated in the didactic staff of the university I'm studing in. I'm basically translating/improving on some scientific papers my colleagues write monthly (they are all MDs, specialized microbiologists) and I'm also teaching microbiology for second year students in the practical part - some sort of lab assistant, I'm not sure about the proper terminology for my activity. As I somehow want to prepare my academic pathway already, I thought about refreshing/renewing/updating my universities curricula and the according textbook for the students. I talked with my instructor and he basically told me, that they need a completely new textbook for the dentistry medical students, which I should write, and which also will get published. I initially asked him to update the textbook for the general medicine  students, and add some topics I am interested in, such as the microbiome for example, but he came up with the idea to write a completely new book for the dentistry students, as it should be more condensed than the general medicine one and they don't have one yet. He knows I'm really trying to improve the way of teaching, the materials, presentations, the curricula in general, as here, it kind of got rusty and there is not a lot of motivation of the teaching staff, I want to change that - and I already get positive feedback by the students I'm teaching. I know, this might sound a little bit strange, but that's the academical standard of the country I study in. As I am completely new to this, I would like to know, how I should start to approach this task. I am very excited and I hope that won't subside upon tackling this challenge. I want to try to do my best in improving the quality of material provided to the students.

856,Describing a New Genus and Species,"Hello /r/microbiology! Long time lurker, first time poster. Long story short: does anyone here have experience describing a new species of bacteria? If so, I could use some guidance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I work in R&amp;D as a bacteriologist (herpetologist by training, which is a long and irrelevant story) for an unnamed biotech company. Last year I conducted a bioprospecting blitz searching for a particular phenotype that was of interest to my employer. Promising candidates were sent off for 16s identification, and one came back as an unknown genus, unknown species, but with a probable family identification. This basically took the organism off our radar, as the company was hoping for something on the FDA's GRAS list (a hope not grounded in the literature, but I digress). Eventually it became clear that this organism was our best shot, so we sent it off to have an annotated gene sequence to see if it fell near anything GRAS. 

&amp;#x200B;

The result came back that the organism was possibly from Genus A, possibly from Genus B, but that the genome structure was completely unlike either and in any case no close relatives were GRAS listed. At that point my employer lost interest in trying to cram this organism through regulatory approvals. To my great sadness, I sunk it into glycerol stock and forgot about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just came across the organism again during a recent inventory of my cultures, and got permission from my boss to write up a species description independently. So what I have is a basic set of information on the organism: Gram stain, morphological characteristics, the fact that it degrades Compound X in benchtop assays, and an annotated gene sequence. At this point I'm on my own if I want to take it further. 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that what I need are a battery of lipid profiles and biochemical tests to satisfy the requirements of a standard polyphasic taxonomic approach. However, since this is all on my own nickel at this point I'm a bit reluctant to forge ahead with these tests. I'm torn between wanting to enrich the Tree of Life with this (really freaking cool) organism, and not wanting to deplete my own bank account. 

&amp;#x200B;

So as I see it, I have a few choices. These may or may not be viable, but remember I am an absolute novice to species description: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Write up a description of the species' enzymatic activity, isolation and gene sequence using all of the information I have and hope it's enough for some sort of publication. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Go all-in on the costly lipid and biochemical tests, bank the organism with ATCC, and submit a full publication. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) Find a collaborator with some funding, who would be interested in trading lipid profiling for co-authorship on a paper and the shared honor of naming the new genus and species. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies, I know that was a lot. I'm just trying to find my way forward here without wasting too much time and money. It seems a real shame to have this unique form of life languishing in my freezer when it could be of real interest to others in the community. Thanks in advance to everyone for your time!

901,IMViC Test Done Incorrectly,"In my microbiology lab, my group was given an unknown bacterium last week and we were able to deduce it to either E. coli or Enterobacter aerogenes (and possibly Pseudomonas putida) after looking at the gram stains under a microscope and conducting an oxidase test. We messed up on our IMViC test... We did pretty much everything wrong. We were only supposed to inoculate our bacterium into the test tubes and then incubate them for 48 hours to let the bacteria grow, but we proceeded to add the drops of reagents into our test tubes. We didn't see any reactions and then gave our test tubes to our lab assistant to incubate them. In addition, we forgot to add KOH (potassium hydroxide) into our Voges Proskauer test tube and we foolishly waited for 45 minutes with no reaction occurring. Lastly, a member of my group did not know how to transfer the bacteria onto the Citrate slant and decided to mix the bacteria with the citrate so it looked like mixed jello in a test tube.



Tomorrow, we will be receiving our incubated test tubes back. Is it too late to redeem ourselves from this catastrophic failure? We did 2 trials of IMViC tests and the most reliable test we have is the citrate slant which can help differentiate E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. One citrate slant had bacteria transferred correctly onto the surface while the other one was the mixed up jello. Do you think the mixed up citrate slant will react and change colors to blue if it is Enterobacter? What about the other test tubes we have that had reagents added to it before they were incubated? Will there be a reaction if reagents are added again or if I add KOH to the VP tube?

908,Strange growth found on an agar plate,"Hello everyone! I work in a molecular genetics laboratory and last July I used 5 agar plates to colonize some bacteria and broke them down to get DNA polymerase for my PCR reactions. After cleaning out a fridge this afternoon I found one of the plates had this unique growth on it, but I have no idea what this is. It is around the size of a dime and grew physically into the agar to the bottom of the plate. This is the only instance of any type of unintentional growth on any of the 5 plates. No other mold/fungi grew on any plate. The only other thing present on the plate are the bacteria I cultured for the polymerase, which are also visible. The plate has been air-sealed since last July, and has not been opened since. Any idea what the name of this strange organism is to satisfy my own curiosity? Google got me nothing that looks anything like this. Thanks guys!

I've done a lot of research and car insurance in my state is around 1500 yearly (no fault state), rent at an apartment in a safe area would be around $600-$700, I have to have Verizon because it is one of (ATT is the other) only reliable providers in my state and at my university, I need to have access to health insurance because I have a thyroid condition, and in state tuition here is very expensive so I'll be around 40,000-50,000 in debt. It just seems like, working in a lab, with my bachelors, I'd be struggling to get by, and needing to work a second job. 

In a job, I would like a work/life balance and a 9-5ish job. I've worked a lot of 10 hour shifts at crazy hours and I do not like it.  I'd also like a job that requires me to use my hands a lot, some computer work is fine and doesn't phase me. I just don't want to be glued to that.

My goal isn't to become rich. I just don't want to be crippled by my debt or barely making ends meet. Ideally, I would just like to have a house, a boat, and a few nice things every once and a while. My mom does this on her salary at 70k. I know six figures isn't necessary. 

I like medicine, but I think I am more AgNatResource based. I really really do not like coding or stats. I can't see myself getting  a PhD, but a masters wouldn't be out of consideration. 

I tacked Food Science onto my degree, and with summer classes, I could finish in 4-4.5 years. With just micro, I'd be on track to leave December 2021. Would you recommend that I stay on this path?

Reading on past here is not necessary, but it offers the insight into this that I've gained and am currently querying. I'm not a scientist, but I am curious to learn about something that has stumped my last 5 gastroenterologists. **To clarify, I'm not seeking medical advice nor a diagnosis.**


I was put onto anti-depressants in my early teens. Shortly after going onto them, and including after I weened off said anti-depressant, I began developing GI attacks lasting 6-8 hours each, consisting primarily of a very unusual **key symptom**; absolutely foul tasting 'rotten egg' burps not dissimilar to hydrogen sulfide that could not be eliminated by belching, along with rapid small intestinal emptying. I had myself tested for Giardia, H Pylori, and a slew of other pathogens, as well as gastric emptying studies. Even during episodes, my LFTS were clear. Gastroenterologists suggested ""Small intestinal bacterial imbalance / overgrowth""


Many years passed and these attacks slowly stopped over 4 years. After 11 years further attack-free, I started taking Bupropion (NDRI) and sure enough, these attacks came back within 2 weeks.


What is curious, is that I've interviewed a multitude of other people experiencing these attacks over the years, and there appears to be a striking correlation between specific people starting on anti-depressants (SSRIs, SNRIs and NDRIs so far) and experiencing these attacks within a month of starting. These people have been otherwise healthy prior to starting medication. The attacks have continued in all cases even when the anti-depressant is discontinued, and there doesn't appear to be any specific 'trigger'. The intermission period between attacks is consistent per-person, but not consistent with the next person. It may be 1 week between attacks for person X, or 8 months between attacks for person Y, but it will remain consistent for that person.


Many gastroenterologists for the aforementioned people have also theorised that the issue is due to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. I've also been finding that those interviewed also tend to experience specific symptoms either when sugar is consumed, or insulin is is produced (including those with diabetes using insulin and non-insulin injections such as Trulicity or Victroza). I cannot find mention of it in other medical literature outside the occasional mention of it for Giardia Lamblia, or Helicobacter Pylori.


So with that, I'm left a bit starved for info; is there any currently recognised effects of anti-depressants on the gut microbiome, and for bonus points; Is the introduction of insulin known to aggravate any existing bacteria to the extent that they give off extraordinary amounts of what appears to be hydrogen sulfide?",microbiology,1551870763,JasperCarmack,7,0,True,2019-03-06

971,I (19F) am a Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever case and I want to share my story so I can get answers,"Hello my micro friends, this is my first time posting to this sub but I have some questions that I have been itching (pun intended) to get answered. I’m gonna try to keep this short, but feel free to ask me any questions I’m an open book and I find this disease very fascinating so I would love to discuss it. 
So back in my senior year of high school I was sitting under a tree on a college campus with a close friend. a week later I was in the middle of a calculus test and I have a habit of rubbing my upper spine towards my neck when I get anxious. To my surprise I found a very tender spot that then I picked at revealed a fat tick. Now I am a lover of entomology so this didn’t send me into a panic, instead I made sure to kill it and place it in a trash can next to me so I could resume my test. I’m from central Missouri so ticks are common so I thought nothing of it.
 Fast forward a week later I notice spots appear on my hands and I am feeling dizzy and tired. I work in a nursery so the first diagnosis was foot and mouth. As you all probably know, foot and mouth is treated by lots of rest and it goes away on its own. So I was on about a week of bedrest until my mom got nervous about the progression of the spots and my lethargy.
I go to a military base for my medical treatment, so they’re not really used to getting strange cases like mine. When I walk in they quarantined me and I was interrogated to see what biological warfare my immigrant mother and I had brought to the base. The doctors scarred their heads until I mentioned I was bit by a tick some weeks ago. A lightbulb went off and they started rushing in and out of the room grabbing other doctors to look at me. Meanwhile I was just thinking how the lights were too bright and I wanted to sleep. The doctors put me on an intense regiment of doxycycline and sent me home saying any worsening of my condition should be treated as an emergency and I was to go to the hospital.
Try to keep in mind, I was a almost graduated senior so I had lots of graduation parties and events to attend to, so I probably pushed myself more than I should have. On the day of graduation rehearsal I showed up and immediately I was met with a hundred questions. When I left on the last day of school I was a normal teenage girl, now I looked like America’s next top plague victim. I tried to brush it off and say I was in remission but I was wrong. During the senior slideshow I collapsed and was taken by an administrator to the school nurse. I begged her not to call an ambulance and she listened under the condition my mother would take me to the hospital. And at the hospital it’s when I realize how bad my condition actually is.
So let me explain how I looked and felt. I would upload some pictures but my mom and the hospital are the only ones with them and I don’t know how I feel about putting pictures of my feet on the internet. Anyways, hundreds of raised red spots covered every inch of me with exception to my face. And I could feel every single one. However they didn’t itch like you would expect, instead they were painful to touch and even the sensation of clothing against my skin made me cringe. In addition to these spots, my skin was a strange pale yellow and my eyes were adorned with bags and dark circles. I really don’t care much about appearance though, the thing that bothered me the most was the sensation. My nerves were on fire, it felt like electricity was emanating from the tips of my fingers to my shoulders and from my toes to my neck.  I had trouble holding objects because I had the constant sensation of my arms being asleep or the static feeling  you get when you hit your funny bone.
When I walked into the doctors office I had another occurrence of quarantine and questioning. However this time I got placed in a comfortable bed. When the RN’s came in to check on me I guess they hadn’t read my file. From the chin down I looked ok, and I was huddled under a hospital blanket when they came in. One of them gently asked me what was wrong, and in response I uncovered myself. I swear they lost all the color in their faces and the RN in charge turned to the other and said “go get the camera, NOW.”
I was confused and she told me that they had never seen a case of Rocky Mountain so severe and they needed to document it. I just said “cool I hope I end up in a textbook”
The rest of the visit ended up consisting of lots of different staff members coming to look at my rare condition, 2 bags of saline water, some random stuff injected into me, and lots and lots of blood/pee tests. I felt like such a spectacle, lots of doctors telling me “oh I have to show this to -insert someone less experienced than them- they’ll probably only ever get to see this once” but I liked the attention so I was ok with it. 
Here’s where the story gets weird, when the blood tests came back, I was negative for Rocky Mountain. The doctors were in shock and even said the tests are wrong and they would bet their career on that’s what it is. Everyone was confused. However fast forward several months I’m eating lunch with a college professor who specializes in microbiology and diseases. He informed me that apparently central Missouri has a strain of Rocky Mountain that is unique and doesn’t show up on the standard test. It felt like the biggest mystery in my life had been solved. 
Yet now I’m back to that having questions phase. I was never able to get in with the infectious disease specialist because the doctors on base didn’t contact them until AFTER  the spots had disappeared. And I don’t know what webMD type articles I trust, so I’m asking for the opinion of micro nerds because engineering school doesn’t teach you these things. I’m a very thin person, but after the disease I’ve still felt particularly weak is this just in my head? And also I’ve struggled with mental Illness my entire life yet somehow in this same timeframe my meds had to be changed and I’m struggling to adapt to my new college environment. 
I don’t expect to get all the answers but I just thought someone might find my story interesting and I also wanted to get it written down before it fades from memory. 
Side note: this disease was GREAT for my graduation party! I had a shared party with my best friends and during it I was propped up in a recliner and my boyfriend was employed as my butler. He would bring me water and whatever else I asked for and stop people from crowding me. I’m not a huge fan of parties so having an excuse to sleep during mine was great. In addition I didn’t have to help with the set up or clean up. But probably best of all, I made bank. I guess seeing me in a recliner covered in spots really touched people because the pity money kept flowing. I expected maybe $300 from my grad party because that just seemed proportional to the number of people there to see me. However I ended up making more than all of my other friends. Of course they teased me for “using” my condition to get pity cash but the only think I asked of anyone was water from my boyfriend. It was a nice end to my high school career, just to see how much my peered cared about me. 

TL:DR
I got bit by a tick my senior year of high school and developed a mysterious disease that sounds like a delicious ice-cream flavor. I almost missed graduation and now all my senior pictures look like I’m dead. But hey, at least I maybe ended up in a medical textbook!

981,Some advise from my fellow microbiology-people,"My first language isn’t English, so bear with me. The field is bacteriology. 

I recently started a new job (I’ve been here for like 5 weeks), and before I started I got the impression this was a really good gig; a big new hospital, a part of the biggest educational institution in the country, a lot of reference functions (ie medical mycology and others), work with interesting samples, better salary and good working conditions. 

The place I worked before was a very small lab, but I did get training into working with all kinds of samples and actually interpret results and such. In other words, I was involved in every step of the way with the samples, from registration, to inoculation, and finished results. 

In this new place, firstly I’m put in the molecular unit, which I have no interest in working in (mainly because it’s not that interesting to me, and I already struggle with my pipette arm...), without any say in the matter. Secondly, I’m the fourth new employee in 3 months, one of whom already has changed her workplace. Thirdly, most of the actual work with results here are done by the doctors, and us mlts are put to do most of the mundane tasks. And then the work environment is kinda shit, people complain a lot and there’s always overtime work (without pay), and a lot of people are sick a lot. The lab is also very cramped and messy, and the equipment is old. I know this is something one has to expect from the public sector, but still. There are changes in motion, but what will happen and when I don’t know. 

What annoys me the most is that I declined another offer because I thought this would be a better career move. This other job I’d earn more, work less and the environment there is amazing (I know someone who works there). It’s also more like my old job. The only thing it’s in a different city. 

So my question is, would you stay, or apply for a new job (there’s currently a two year contract at the bigger hospital bacteriology lab that’s open, where the environment is better and I can work even shifts also)? I have a permanent position here, which is the main perk I’d say. Also I feel bad for thinking about leaving because I know they struggle. Should I care about that or just myself? 

TLDR: my new job isn’t what I thought it would be, should I stay or should I go? Do I owe them for hiring me?

985,Question about dermarolling,"A dermaroller is a skin care device used for collagen induction therapy.

They are usually purchased online from sites like Amazon. I noticed that many say ""This item is returnable,"" which is disconcerting since it punctures the skin.

15,Is it a harsh marking?,"Hi all,
There was an issue needed someone to give a judgement. My friend is an undergraduate student and recently he faced a very bad situation. He got a very low mark (5/20) for his essay question despite of his well preparation for this topic. Although he complained for his grade but the marker refused to give any feedback. I just post my friend's answer and hope somebody could judge if the mark is harsh or fair?
Exam essay question: Microbial food related illnesses are treated differently in food quality guideline based on factors related to the causative organism, the food type and the illness outcomes. Use examples to explore and describe these differences. (20 marks)
Student answer: Foodborne illness is a infection or intoxication that result from eating the food contaminated by microbioorganisms or their toxins. It can be divided into three types: intoxication, infection and toxication. Due to the different causative organism, food type and symptoms of the illness, there are different quality guidelines for the food related illness.
Intoxication occurs when ingesting a pre-formed toxin. The toxin is present in the contaminated food. It is produced by a pathogen while growing in the food. Ingestion of the food contained the toxins not the viable microorganisms, is necessary to cause poisoning. The toxin can be heat stable or heat labile. Symptoms occur generally quickly and differ with the type of toxin. Staph food poisoning is an example.
Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive coccus which causes the staphylococcal food intoxication. It naturally presents in human skin and nose. It can be found from the meat, poultry, seafood or contaminated by handling. When the bacteria growing in the food, it could produce heat stable enterotoxin which does not destroy by normal cooking. After consumption the contaminated food, the vagus never is stimulated and cause severe vomiting. The treatments of this intoxication involve reducing the initial load of S.aureus such as selecting the high quality raw material, sanitation and proper personal hygiene.
Infection occurs as a result of consumption of foods containing the microbial cells. The cells remain live during the consumption. The viable cells should be consumed through food and survive after ingestion. The microorganisms, even if present at low level, have the potential to establish and multiply in digestive tract to cause the disease. Symptoms occur after 24 hours, could be both enteric and non-enteric. Lysteriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes is an example of infection.
Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive, psychrotrophic, motile, small rod. It present in the soil and could be found in meat, poultary and milk. It causes illness associated with immunologically challenged populations including pregnant women, newborns, infants, elderly people and immunocompromised individuals. Following ingestion, the organisms pass through the stomach, reach in small intestine. They produce virulence factors which cause gastroenteritis. After adhesion, invasion and translocation through intestinal tract, they come into blood circulation and are transported to liver, brain or other parts of body to cause invasive systemic disease. To prevent this infection, a variety of strategies are developed include completely cooking, washing, separating the raw meat from the other food and proper hygiene.
Toxicoinfection occurs from ingesting a large number of microbial cells which release toxins in the body to cause symptom. In general, a number of organisms are needed. Bacillus aureus gastroenteritis is an example.
Bacillus aureus is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore former. The spores can survive at high heat temperature. When ingesting the food contaminated by the microbial cells or spores, spores could geminate and cells multiply. The toxins are produced during the cell growth. When cells are lysed, the toxins are released and cause illness. The main symptom of this toxication is diarrhea. B.aureus can be found in dust, soil. Their microbial cells can contaminate the meat while their spores could present in vegetables. To prevent this illness, the food should be stored at the temperature at which the spores do not germinate (&lt;4oC or &gt;60 oC). Also hygiene measures are required to control this problem.
In sum, different foodborne illnesses require different strategies to keep the food quality and safe to the consumers.",microbiology,1494278462,fox_hanks,6,0,True,2017-05-08

I'm an undergrad student in the Health Sciences, and recently encountered a multiple choice question on a quiz that (I felt) to be worded in such a way that there was no ""best answer"".

The question was: ""Which characteristic describes why some pathogens do not cause disease in humans?"". The answer they wanted was ""receptor binding"", but also offered ""pathogenicity"" as an option, in addition to two unrelate terms. 

I chose pathogenicity. If the genetic propensity of a pathogen to cause disease in a human host is absent or extremely low, would that not satisfy the question? My initial motivation for ""questioning the question"" was related to (my limited understanding of) live-attenuated vaccines, but I would prefer a ""naturally"" occurring example to satisfy my curiosity. I've been searching for these answers independently, but I'm not finding material that specifically answers my question. Can anyone give me an example of a pathogen that will bind to  / infect a human host (qualified as ""receptor binding"", but won't necessarily cause disease? Do all pathogens bind to human receptors?

100,noobie in microbio REALLY needs help with an 'outbreak' investigation,"so i had a microbiology practical in the uni, its an 'advanced' lab skills together with the course. the assessment however is unusual and with an excess of so many variables i'm really having a hard time to 'crack' this 'outbreak'. 
so at the end of the period we had 3 weeks (each week we had two half-days of labs) to investigate this 'outbreak' in the hospital. 
case we were given was - previous week 4 E. coli isolates were found in the stool samples, one in medium care unit and 3 in intensive care unit. from the surveillance data it is shown that the patient in MCU (he was in ICU before for a bit, then was moved) had no resistance to any antimicrobials, and no plasmid after plasmid typing. other three patients in ICU have a plasmid, two have the same type, and either chloramphenicol or ampicillin resistance.
OUR case now is: in ICU and MCU there are 10 patients in each, we got 10 plates of stool plated on CLED and CA agar plates from ICU patients, and after colony morphology, biochemical testing and plasmid typing we need to declare whether it is an outbreak or not. 

Since there were like 10 groups that got those 10 plates (just differently numbered) everybody endeded with different results an nobody of course has a conclusive answer for the cases similar to ours... because what we got to know - she gave us 6/10 e. coli plates (mixed cultures) and we, after colony morphology and biochemical testing, had 4 E.coli positive (indole and MUG test positive). After disk diffusion test - no resistance, all were susceptible. Then we had to prepare liquid cultures, butfor each isolate we prepared liquid with either no antibiotics, and with chloramphenicol, and another with ampicillin. Interestingly enough, now two of the isolates showed resistance. we chose the subsequent liquid cultures and performed restriction idgest, but in gel electrophoresis - no bands!! we had one last day so we repeated some steps. after reculturing the bacteria from the liquid cultures with ampicillin 'resistance' - the next day one strain lost the resistance, the liquid was clear... so then we done the plasmid typing only on those 3 left (as thats what we had left from the liquid cultures) and yet again no bands.... 

what can we possibly declare from this? afte days of literature reading, found nothin like ""non-pathogenic E. coli found in stool samples without any resistance and no plasmid was then declared to be the causative agent for colonisation outbreak in ICU"" HAHAHHA .... i'm screwed ;) please help ",microbiology,1495796658,iloveitblack,27,4,True,2017-05-26

105,Gram-negative bacterial cell fractionation alternatives?,"Hi everyone,

I am characterizing a multi-protein carbohydrate-degrading system in Gram-negative bacteria. Specifically, I am trying to determine the location (periplasm or cytoplasm) of one of the monosaccharide products following growth of the bacterium on the parent carbohydrate source. Ideally, I would like to visualize the presence of this small sugar by TLC.

Traditional osmotic shock protocols using sucrose to fractionate the contents of the cellular compartments (periplasm vs. cytoplasm) leave massive sucrose backgrounds which interfere with our ability to visualize anything useful by TLC. I'm thinking about using HPAEC-PAD to see if we can find the monosaccharide instead, which is an option.

Does anyone know of any protocols whereby the outer and inner membranes can be differentially lysed such that the periplasm v. cytoplasm contents can be analyzed?

im studying for an exam where weve been given data before hand that discusses the salmonella infection process and asks us to identify when we would see gene activity of specific genes, using a promoterless luciferase assay. These include effectors like SopB but also TCS genes like PrmA and EnvZ. I understand how PrmA works, by promoting transcription of genes in response to the signal obsevred by PrmB, iron, pH etc. However, when this PrmA protein upregulates the genes, pgbP as an example, is the PrmA gene also active and thus would we observe luciferase activity when the TCS is active, or would this gene activity be observed way before the actual signal is observed. 
I hope this makes sense, if not i can expand!

I am interested in doing some experiments and would like some suggestions for some good starting experiments.

Looking around on the web there are a lot of experiments but they're designed for children. I am looking for something more advanced and interesting and geared towards adults, not elementary school kids.

I have checked out a cheek swab but couldn't understand well what I was looking at. Also have done the obligatory semen viewing, which was interesting if a little gross. I am thinking of trying to check out blood cells but am not sure if 600x is enough for that.

I have been into culturing yogurt and kefir for years now, and naturally those were some of the first things under my scope. It was interesting to see them, but I have doubts about my slide prep techniques, focus-finding techniques and I don't always recognize exactly what I'm looking at.

I'm also interested in trying to culture yeasts and fungi and maybe learning how to isolate mutations and grow them into larger colonies, for baking, fermenting, etc. So I'd like to do some experiments that will help teach to do this safely, as well as help me learn sterilization techniques and safety procedures. I would particularly like to know more about pathogenic/toxic stuff - especially how to work with it safely if it intentionally or unintentionally appears in my petri dishes, how to safely work around opened petri's, and how to detoxify and dispose of it safely. I have glass petri dishes for what it's worth.

My ""Lab"" is just a room in my home and I don't have access to high end lab equipment, and don't intend on going too deep with my experiments. Would like to get into this hobby without having to full lab here.

Any advice appreciated, keeping in mind my current max magnification is 600x. Open to buying an 100x oil objective if it will let me do more interesting experiments.

There are many great labs studying bacterial pathogens, and many great translational virology labs, but it seems like there are very few translational bacteriology labs?  

It seems like there are either 1) medicinal chemistry labs developing compounds 2) microbiology labs doing some level basic research that they just market as having relevance to therapy design without actually intending on translating their findings to development ie having a PLoS Pathogens paper about a new adhesin or bacterial regulatory pathway doesn't mean the lab is *actually involved in therapy design*.  

**Why?** I colleague argued that virologist are much more productive in the translational medicine space than bacteriologist, and I'd like to have some examples of successful translational microbiology labs.  All I can find are medicinal chemistry labs or basic research labs masquerading as translational research because they happen to work on a pathogenic bug.  I'm not looking for a virologists vs bacteriologist response, just some examples of ""successful"" translational microbiology labs! It's not like they need to have a drug on the market or anything, just something to say a lab took their findings and is *actually* trying to develop it into a treatment (not just saying there is potential in their papers or talks).

Personally, I think it would be Rabies virus. It already has the potential to induce altered behavior in humans (i.e. hydrophobia), not to mention that it makes animals rabid. There has also been a [case study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4372763/) showing an instance where a man exhibited altered behaviors (e.g. disorientation, disorganization, spastic movements, unstable gait, and even aggression) six years after the initial exposure. Of course, the major limiting factor in Rabies' ability to instigate the zombie apocalypse is its long incubating period (weeks to months). As soon as you hear someone getting bitten by anything you just put them in quarantine and the virus reaches a dead end. 

There are other microbial candidates out there that have been shown to alter host behavior (such as *T. gondii, Strepsiptera, Mymecolacidae,* and of course the ever-infamous *Ophiocordyceps*), but to my knowledge they don't induce any sort of aggression.

237,Issues Showing Listeria monocytogenes's Umbrella Motility in lab,"Hi. I'm currently an undergrad and I work as a prep TA for my pathogenic microbiology lab course. I'm going through species every week and running tests done that the students will do in the actual course (it's a spring course usually, but I'm doing tests and creating new stock this summer because this last spring had numerous issues regarding certain test results not showing up correctly, or some species not even growing at all). I've basically been tasked to go through each species and confirm their purity using results and observations of each. 

The issue I'm running into is with L. monocytogenes. I know the umbrella motility is a smoking gun of the bacteria, but for some reason it never appears. Past teachers can also recall not being able to see it, so this has been an ongoing issue for years for the class. I started looking into the issue and I came across a few sources that actually had motility media for L. mono in mind. 

This is the current in house recipe used for all motility media (adjusted values for 100 mL batch): 
Tryptose...1g
NaCl...0.5g
Bacto Agar 0.4g (The original manual for this amount came from a 0.1-0.4% estimate on the amount of agar needed)
Beef Extract...0.1g
TTC...0.5mL

We found that some sources say both to use TTC and not to use TTC while making the media. The source I found online has the recipe below(also adjusted values for 100 mL):
Peptone...1g
NaCl...0.5g
Bacto Agar...0.35g
Beef Extract...0.1g

We're running a test now where the two variances of the recipes were made with TTC and tubes without TTC. Temperature is also being taken into account, so I have tubes growing at 30C and others at room temp. Has anyone else had issues seeing L. mono's umbrella motility in lab? And if so, how did you fix it? I don't wanna rule out the strain just yet, because of the info. I found stating ways to make Listeria specific motility media.

Unfortunately we did not observe a blood type specific binding. Our hypotheses for this so far are:

a) The bacteria ate the carbohydrate linkers since the linkers were neither protected nor secured

I'm following a trail of thought, an idea for an agricultural application in which silicone rubber could be used to intentionally grow bacteria (beneficial kinds).  Is there something about silicone rubber that just inhibits bacterial growth?  If the needs of the bacteria are met (nutrients, temperature, ph, oxygen, water, etc.) would bacteria thrive on silicone rubber just like any other surface?

&amp;nbsp;

As I'm writing this I discovered **porous** silicone rubber is a thing and it can be used for ""growing cells or living tissues"".  That sounds good for increasing surface area, but if I wanted aerobic bacteria while avoiding anaerobic bacteria would a porous structure just lead to anaerobic pockets (the pores themselves)?  Maybe it just depends on the size of the pores?

&amp;nbsp;

282,Help troubleshooting changes in morphology of fungal cultures.,"This summer I started working with one of my microbiology professors in his lab to gain lab experience (I currently have very limited experience). Our first project is dealing with about 100 different fungus cultures that have been isolated from soil samples. The fungus is being grown on MEA slants and one of my duties is to make new MEA slants and reculture the samples periodically. After the most recent reculturing, I  noticed that a large number of the samples had significant changes in their morphology (primarily color).  Fungus cultures that were originally red turned to white, originally green turned to white, original black turned to white. This happened to about 60% of the fungus cultures. The majority of the samples that did not change morphology were white to begin with and remained white. After noticing this happened, my first instinct was that my aseptic technique was faulty and I may have contaminated the cultures. To test this I scrutinized my technique and had my professor double check that I was doing it properly. After that I selected a few of the fungus cultures that had changed morphology to reculture. For the reculturing I inoculated 3 slants from the original cultures ( the one with the initial morphology i.e. Red) and inoculated 3 slants from the more recent culture of that sample that had undergone a change in its morphology to white. I did this for 4 separate fungus samples that had changed in morphology. 
After incubation for 3 days at 30C I removed the cultures.   The results that I had hoped to see were that the original morphologies would be retained from the cultures taken from the original slants. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. Nearly all of the samples where the same white morphology even though thy had coke from samples that were originally red, green, and black. A few of the samples that had come from white fungus samples had changed its morphology to large circular colonies that where black with a white ring around the edges. 
At this point I'm not exactly sure where to go next. The only other thing that I can think of is that this is related to different stages in the fungus life cycles. My professor is out of town for the next week and I'd like to solve this problem with his help ( to impress him I suppose). It would be great if someone could help my identify reasons for this occurrence or point me towards literature that could aid me. Thank you.

I am doing this by transferring, with a borer, fungi from the stock plate onto agar in a Petri dish. Then incubating the fungi at a set temperature (15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees Celsius) for 3 days then afterwards, transferring again with a borer the fungi onto agar in another plate but this time a plate that has been recently cultured with bacteria from one of the stock bacteria culture tubes. After time, as bacteria grows, a zone of inhibition should form around the central fungi where bacteria was not able to grow due to the antibiotics produced by the fungi. I'll be measuring the zone of inhibition every 12 hours for 3 days. Since each trial will take around a week to complete, multiplying this by the amount of temperatures (5) I will be testing, it'll take around 35-40 days to finish the experiment.

2) On the topic of H. Pylori; I'm curious if the reason some people get ulcers and some are completely asymptomatic is caused by a lack bacterial diversity and competition for specific niches within the stomach much like what we see with E. coli and C. Diff which are normal inhabitants of our microbiome.

I have microbiology as one of my classes this semester. I am quite bad at everything I try doing, so I am not  surprised this has happened to me, and I keep making elementary mistakes. Every time I use the inoculation loop, nothing grows on the culture medium. This has happened two times already so clearly I am doing something very wrong. When I asked the microbiology masters’ students (who help with supervising the class) what went wrong with my culture they laughed at my face and asked me if I had truly inserted the loop into the sample. I did the whole process, step by step, of heating the loop and the wire, waiting a few seconds to cool off, placing the loop into the sample (in this case it was urine in a test tube, with streptococci), collecting the “inoculum” and then finally streaking it on the agar plate. Basically, what I want with this post is to figure out what I could have possibly done wrong, because everyone else's culture was fine. I do not want to ask the professor because I am not really in the mood to be further humiliated.

I've never used broth microdilution to determine MICs before. Yesterday I inoculated ~10^4 cells into wells with different concentrations of an inhibitor. I incubated the plates statically for 18 h and took OD600 measurements every 30 min. See [here](http://i.imgur.com/USGgDsS.png) for my plot. Note, there was no OD600 change over the first 4 h so I didn't plot it. 

How would you define the MIC? Would you call it the concentration where there is no growth? Or would you consider it to be the concentration before the cultures take off? How do you consider the intermediates between the two?

413,Grad school stress and concerns,"Hello, fellow microbiologists (aspiring or otherwise)! I'll be graduating next May and was wondering if I could get some advice given my somewhat unconventional situation.

Some background:
I started my undergraduate career in 2014. Got accepted into the microbiology program at a nearby school, but coming from a very sheltered background, I never really got to develop any personal ambitions. I was unsured what I wanted to do or could do with a BS in microbiology, but somewhere along the line I got interested in research and academia. I did a semester of undergraduate research in genetics/molecular biology at my home institution, and I just got back from a two month REU program at an R1 institution where I did bioinformatics/microbial ecology work, which I enjoyed. However, my true interests lie in medical microbiology, particularly in the field of sexually transmitted infections/infectious diseases/public health. 

I had planned to graduate in 5 years instead of the usual 4 years (actually, most micro majors at my school finish in 5 years so I wasn't that much of and outlier) so I could take it easy and also maybe get a Psych minor. However, my state, and thus my home institution have been in economic turmoil for a while, and the government intends to impose harsh austerity measures that mean staying here another year isn't such a good option anymore, and so I'm accelerating my coursework so I can graduate in May. Because I had planned on graduating in 2019 and not 2018, I hadn't really focused on researching grad school options or preparing for the GRE, so now I have two do all that in the two and a half months before grad schools start taking applications.

I've already looked at a couple graduate school, but I don't really ""feel the spark"" with any of them. I'll definitely be applying to the aforementioned R1 institution I was at this summer, and what I enjoyed the most there was how warm and welcoming the people were. 

So my concerns are as follows:


1) I'll probably be taking the GRE in October so that gives me a month and a half to study. Is that good enough? What cheap/free study materials would you suggest? Any strategies to make the most out of this short time?


2) How did you guys choose which schools to apply to? How did you get a feel for what kind of places they were?


3) Did you compromise at all in terms of research interests? From what I can tell, most of the research done in microbiology is in environmental microbio, or microbial ecology, or all sorts of -omics. These aren't my favorite fields, but I did work on them this summer and liked them alright and could definitely grow to like them more. Any tips for finding faculty with similar research interests?


4) Is there any difference to having an assistant prof. or associate prof. or plain old prof as your adviser? Should you email them before applying or wait till you get in?

I'm sorry if this is too much, but I'll appreciate y'all's input!

By this logic shouldn't eukaryotes share the same lipid membrane as archaea with glycerol 1-phosphate heads and phytanyl tails with ether linkage instead of FA tails and ester linkage?

Just about everyone went straight to the bathroom only to find that the toilet seat was surprisingly clean. Nothing grew. (The floor, pay phone and cell phones were teaming with bacteria).

However, at a gym the toilet seats are a little different since everyone is very sweaty. Do you think this makes the sanitizers worth it? ",microbiology,1503332591,C-elegant,5,1,True,2017-08-21

479,Interesting Job Ideas,"Hi all,


I'm looking for some job ideas. I'm a biology major that is Micro specific. I was planning on getting a Microbiology major but my college cut the program before I was able to sign a major. So I am a Biology major now, with a crap ton of Microbiology courses, and some experience working for a professor. I have two questions:
#1: My work with a professor still counts as lab experience, right? I'm in charge of set up and tear down of the labs students take with their classes, so I make media, grow cultures, etc for all of the Microbiology and Genetics courses at my college. I'm worried that since it isn't really research based it doesn't count for as much. Is it appropriate to tell employers I have experience in a lab? By the time I graduate I will have 2 years experience in this job. 

#2: What entry level positions are available to me with this degree and my experience? I'm interested in Micro, but I'm afraid my Biology degree will limit my opportunities in Micro.  I don't have any other certifications or anything and would prefer to know my options with 2 years of lab ""experience"" and a Biology degree. 




On a slightly related note,
I wanted to ask any advice on another matter. Whenever I autoclave media, I end up wasting a bunch because my media bottles boil up and over.  I obviously can't seal the bottles with a lid, for fear of pressure build up, but is there anything I can do stop losing so much media? I tried covering the tops with aluminum foil but it doesn't seem to help at all. Does anyone else have this problem??

480,DIY Micro Lab BSL1 for mold-Am I doing this right?,"Hi there! I studied clinical bacteriology for a year and gained some useful experience in a public reference lab for my internship a few years ago. I ended up moving away from clinical diagnostics. I need a refresher!

I joined a chemical manufacturing company two years later, for something completely unrelated, but found my roots sticking out! We found mold in the finished product a year later. So after much convincing, my seniors are willing to invest in a home-grown lab. We can consider a larger investment later next year if a need is found for microbiology at my company:

This is what I have so far:

1. 1 gallon mason jar 

2. a heating lamp (75 watts) used for lizards, it fits perfectly over the mason jar to isolate the heat source

3. inoculating loops

4. LB plates and MEA plates (pre-poured)

5. a 121 quart plastic box to hold all of it in

6. a gram stain kit

7. 5 state of the art microscopes (we already had those in the first place...)

8. gloves, swabs, ~~a chemical fume hood (lol, use what you've got)~~

Am I doing this right? Do I need anything else to complete the experiment?

**The experiment:**

**Objective**: grow mold, identify the mold in our final product.

**Controls:**
the clean product that has no mold

**Variables:** strawberry mold (Botrytis cinerea), the moldy product we got back and generic bread yeast

**procedure:**

1. set up incubator: heating lamp goes on top of the mason jar. it fits perfectly. I tested the temperature, its 37C after 30 minutes of the lamp on. 

2. inoculate three labeled plates with variable fungi

3. place plates in makeshift incubator, wait 24 hours

4. observe plates, if there are colonies present on the plate, I did this correctly. 

5. put single colony (10um loop) onto slide. mix with alcohol. heat slide to fix

**6. stain the slide according to gram stain method. &lt;------is this right? I don't remember exactly how to mount mold...**

7. Identify the mold

**Current status:**
I put the mystery mold under the microscope already, and according to the hyphea morphology, my preliminary hypothesis is that this is a Cladosporium. I will run the experiment listed above once the steps are confirmed correct. I only have 10 of each kind of plates so I don't want to run the risk of doing it wrong.

So, am I doing it right? Where can I improve? Am I missing any supplies? Is 37C too hot for mold growing?

Thanks in advance reddit!

PS. Some internet sloothing told me I don't need anaerobic tank or CO2 already. I was originally going to use the mason jar to create facultative anaerobic conditions with a tight seal and a lit candle to suck out as much oxygen as possible. Let me know if you think I should do this anyway, even though I have obligate aerobe molds (I think)

I was in biology class learning about antibiotics and how their effectiveness will eventually run out, which got me thinking of NEW alternative ways...

Now, what I am about to ask is going to sound impossible and maybe, silly. But it's an idea lol... a redundant idea... perhaps. 

So, this comes back to the principle of gene therapy and the human and bacterial genomes. 
Would it be possible to implicate a certain gene or modify a gene to express the ability to be resistant to strains of bacterias? Evolved or not evolved strains... What I mean is, LITERALLY ALL! including superbugs.
If this were to be carried out, what would scientists and other experts in the field need to gather in order to make this work? If not, why? 

To me, I'm already thinking of really high expenses in order to retrieve every genome of every bacteria, which will also take time. And obviously, they will change as the bacteria strain will too.

Firstly, I investigated whether it follows my dilution series or not. It does, which suggests that the source is from within the capsule itself, rather than the surroundings or the agar.

Secondly, I isolated E. faecium and positively identified it with PCR testing. I've since re-streaked some plates for fresh, pure E. faecium colonies to act as stock colonies for future students. The contaminant isn't in these colonies (as expected). 

Now that I've isolated E. faecium, my lab instructor has become increasingly interested in the contaminant, because she's never seen it before and has become curious. She'd like me to try to identify the unknown contaminant.

The morphology is a flat, round colony with a pink centre. Young colonies are yellow in colour, mature colonies are pink in the centre with a yellow outer ring. The plates were placed in the fridge to try and slow growth for preservation (of both the contaminant and E. faecium on the same plate), and the unknown continued to develop and eventually the centres became almost a dark red colour (after a two-week school break). These longer-developed colonies look almost ""fuzzy"", which made me think maybe a yeast or a mold.

Trying to isolate the unknown has proven unsuccessful -- I figured my first step would be to try and culture a pure sample of contaminant. When I quadrant streak, I get colonies that are identical in morphology to E. faecium, but PCR says they aren't. I don't get the pink morphology I was expecting.

I'm not sure what to make of this and I'm somewhat stuck. For reference, the bottle claims the following bacterium are present in the capsules:

Lactobacillus helveticus (0.2 billion cfu)
Lactobacillus rhamnosus (3.8 billion cfu)
Bacillus subtilis (0.3 billion cfu)
E. faecium (2.7 billion cfu)

I've googled the morphology of these bacterium and none of them seem to match my contaminant. I do have pictures of my plates, but I'm not necessarily asking for someone to identify the colonies on my behalf, I just don't know where to go from here to positively identify the colonies.

540,Help on random research?,"Hi, I'm a high school student, and was planning on doing research on endospores, most probably of bacillus subtilis. Specifically, I wanted to see the effects of varying amounts of ultrasonic waves. However, when thinking about the project, I ran into some questions: first of all, I don't know how ""good"" of a project this is- in terms of difficulty, and relevance to the real world. Admittedly, I have high aspirations, and really would like to think of a good science fair project. If this is simply too easy of a topic, or has been researched extensively, I'd rather not do it: I'd still probably want to do some sort of research on endospores/endotoxins/antibiotic resistance. (Something about beta lactamase sounds pretty interesting, and stuff). So, if there are any suggestions, that would be appropriate for a level of undergrad research, that would be nice. Secondly, if this is a viable research topic, how would I be able to count the number of viable endospores after I subject the vegetative cells to heating? I know there is a stain that one can do, but how would one be able to tell viable spores from dead ones?

I would love some input from you all about how to strengthen my application for grad school applications. I am very passionate about science and would love to start a PhD program next fall. I am looking for labs that study the evolution of microbiome in relation to host populations (would love to study human systems but am also happy in entomology labs).

I have emailed a few potential advisors and have either recieved no response or have been told their lab will not be accepting students next fall. I need some advice moving forward as to how I can better my chances of getting into programs. Additionally, I have found it difficult to figure out how competitive my application will be and what caliber of programs would be appropriate for me to send my application. 

Degree: I graduated last spring from a competitive liberal arts school with a Biology degree and minors in Chemistry and French lit. My overall GPA was 3.4, my major GPA was 3.6 (although my last year I had a 4.0 taking almost exclusively upper level bio) 

Research Experience: I have research experience working for a lab at the Field Museum in Chicago (studying the evolution of the microbiome) and am currently a lab tech at a synthetic cell biology lab at my alma mater (studying auxin receptors in maize). 

GRE: I took the GRE once (164V/159Q/4) and am unsure if I should take it again or not to raise my score in quant. (?)

Recs: I should have 3 good recs, one from the head of the lab at the Field, one from the head of the lab I am currently working in, and one from my Evolution professor 

Other experience: I have worked as a lab assistant for intro biology labs at my school as well as a 'classroom assistant' for a local high school's biotech class

550,(Update) Unknown contaminant in my petri dish -- how do I start to identify it?,"Some of you asked for updates on the unknown, so ..here it is!

I did some gram staining today and the E. faecium stained as expected (gram positive cocci). I used this to ensure my technique was proper -- like somewhat of a control. The unknown colony, which I prepared two separate samples of, from two separate plates, both showed a very distinct gram-positive bacillus.

It is possible it's lactobacillus, but PCR tests suggested otherwise. I'm going to run another PCR with some more lactobacillus primers, to ensure it wasn't a false negative last time.

The colony morphology also isn't like any lactobacillus I've seen, so we're not close to identifying just yet!

Next step, as you all suggested, is to run a 16s rRNA PCR to identify the species.

551,"How to count ""this"" on Heterotrophic Plate Count?","Hello everyone. 

I'm doing a research, where I have to count the heterotrophic bacteria from some water samples, to see if they meet the legislation.
Currently, in my country, legislation requires that water have less than 500 colony forming units per mL (CFU/mL).

The problem is that on 5 of 16 Petri dishes, a """"cloud"""" appeared, (which I believe to be bacteria) and I do not know how to quantify this in UFC.

[Example 1](https://imgur.com/hl8wwEQ); [Example 1 Scale](https://imgur.com/6oqRHfm)

[Example 2](https://imgur.com/bkm6cjc); [Example 2 Detail](https://imgur.com/mVIZQ7n); [Example 2 Scale](https://imgur.com/bkm6cjc)

[Example 3](https://imgur.com/QGtg3x0); [Example 3 in Microscope](https://imgur.com/lUwlOLc)

I believe this is what Standard Methods cites as ""spreading colonies"" (except the Example 3, because its . However, even reading Standard Methods, I did not understand how to count them, because I do not know what it is:

- ""Colonies that appears to be caused by disintegration of a bacterial clump as agar and sample were mixed"";

- ""A spreader that develops as a film of growth between the agar and bottom of petri dish""; and 

- ""A colony that forms in a film of water at the edge or over the agar surface"", because I've never seen any of them.

Standard Methods: ""The last two types largely develop because of an accumulation of moisture at the point from which the spreader originates"". Can this moisture accumulate even with the facing plate?

Can someone help me identify and count this?
Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: I did not understand how to count, what I believe to be, spreading colonies.

632,Mystery microorganism in saltwater fish tank https://i.imgur.com/qAOBOWO.png,"Hi guys,

https://imgur.com/qAOBOWO.png 

This is a microorganism from my saltwater fish tank. I have not been able to figure out what it is. I do have video also, but let me describe:
Magnification: 800x light microscope, zoomed in to 8x w/Samsung phone. Animal is sessile. Seems attached to any surface by the ""foot"" (left side of this picture) 

""Body"": The cup-shaped area (right side of pic) - this area is where somewhat of a nucleus appears to reside. Food is taken in from ""fingers"" and filtered through this cup and spit out. 

""Fingers"" - There are 8 of these fingers. I have found 3 of these creatures in my aquarium, all have 8 of these, so I do not believe the number to be variable. Each one is covered in oscillating cilia. The purpose of the oscillation is to create water current to draw bacteria &amp; other plankton in for food. Matter is gathered in head/body/cup area (specifically the white half-moon shape on left of head - what seems to be like a stomach), sifted through, then ejected. 

Response to stimuli: When I tap the slide, animal retracts - the long leg stays motionless, but the 8 fingers retract like a feather duster would, quickly. Within 10 seconds, they slowly unfold. The cilia oscillation is continuous.

What I know it is not and why: 
Keratella - At first glance, looks a lot like keratella. However, keratella has a hard outer shell around the body, this creature does not. Additionally, keratella has one flat side, this guy is not flat but has a circular corona when viewed from above. Additionally, keratella will retract to ""eat"" when it captures something - this guy does not.
Vorticella - Vorticella has cilia that spin on the corona - very similar to this guy, and also feed by rotating cilia. However, vorticella have no ""fingers"" and internal structure is somewhat different.
Collotheca - While collotheca have these cilia-covered fingers (3 usually), I cannot find record of them having 8. The head and fingers move in much the same way, but the cilia of collotheca are much longer, and don't rotate. Additionally, when food is caught, collotheca retracts - my guy does not. Last, mine does not move at all. Collotheca sort of ""chases"" prey. 

I would classify this as a sessile ciliate with a short, vase-shaped lorica, a long stalk and 8 (fronds? tentacles? spinettes?).
P.S. - I posted this on species ID before I saw there was a microbiology subreddit!

Okiedokie guys - who knows the answer?!?!?!

EDIT: Here is a video: https://youtu.be/fsRlnA8HRNk 

Plus we have now ruled out:
Hydra - is freshwater, 1cm, motile &amp; this is saltwater, ~40-80μm, sessile
Baby coral - this is a single-celled organism, a ciliate / baby corals are not

1. Will regular laundry detergent and a cold wash be adequate to remove them from my uniform?
2. Is bleach the only thing that will remove C-Diff spores? (not suitable for coloured uniform).
3. Would it be useful to use a Benzalkonium Chloride laundry rinse?

For SIM deep I got negative for both Sulfur and Indole production, and non-motil, I also ran a Motility test to confirm non-motil. For Nitrate, it reduces nitrate to nitrite, MR+ VP- and finally Lysine Decarboxylase positive.

I know this is a lot so just to review:

* Motility: -
* Urease: + but slow hydrolysis 
* SIM: - for both Sulfur and Indole
* Nitrate Broth: Reduced Nitrate
* MR/VP: MR +, VP -
* Lysine Decarboxylase: +

847,"What is the Shelf Life (i.e., stability) of a Liquid Chemically Defined Media ?","Hello Everyone,

I had a question about media storage and shelf life. For a long-term evolution experiment I prepare 20 Liters of chemically defined media in a tinted glass bottle. See the recipe below. I prep the media by mixing all ingredients, adjusting the pH to pH 7.0 with NaOH, and then sterilize via filtration. Usually I wait a week to see if the media is contaminated, and if there is no contamination, then I go ahead and use the media. However, my question is, what do you think the shelf life of this media is? Is it good, say, up to three or four months after the date of preparation? This way I could store it at + 4 oC and use it later without having to prep several other bottles throughout time.

Keep in mind that since this is experimental evolution, we need the composition of the media to be as constant as possible, as to maintain stable selective pressures. My worry is that if not used immediately, there could be some degradation of the carbon sources, amino acids, vitamins, and metals. Perhaps there are some other negative things that could happen to change the chemical composition of the media? However, often times you can buy pre-prepped liquid media where the self life is something like six to twelves months. So perhaps all the chemicals in the media are stable in solution for long periods of time...

I’d be grateful if anyone has any experience or insight on this and, if possible, a more chemical explanation that speaks to the stability of all these chemicals in solution.

Thank you!

Now that I know who's here, I really want to discern what exactly they are doing/how they are interacting.

Would designing a simple growth experiment determine this? For example, examining the growth rates/biomass of Species 1 in the presence of Species 2 vs. how it grows under control conditions?

When doing these assays, I see patterns like [this](https://i.imgur.com/a0uPSfc.png) versus uninhibited colonies like [this](https://i.imgur.com/fPvYzkQ.png) and I'm trying to determine if they are really distinguishable.

My question: Once I culture the cells, how do I quantify them? I'm doing antioxidant chemistry (ABTS TAA antioxidant assay).

I've chosen L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 for this, as it seems affordable and fairly well known. I need to be able to correlate an absorbance reduction figure with something. For the antioxidants, the absorbance reduction is correlated with the molar concentration of the antioxidant. How would I do this with cells? I know I can use the OD of the cultures to approximate the cell count, but I can't seem to find any literature on this strain that would correlate absorbance with cell density. 

I suppose if I kept the incubation conditions extremely consistent, I could correlate the the absorbance reduction with a volume quantity of cell culture. However, this seems to me to be an imperfect solution.

1,Bio manufacturing and Technical/Medical Writing. Anyone in this field? Debating switching to Microbiology.,"Hello there,
   Right now I am 3rd year Biology major, with about 2.5 years to go.
Recently, I've encountered a field known as ""bio manufacturing"", which apparently pays decently well. Saw it on an AskReddit earlier.

And in general, I'm debating if Microbiology will provide me with a more specific skillset in the job market, especially in that field. ts only the biology electives that are interesting for me. As far as I can tell, I can take some of those as my electives if a Microbiology major. Really the only parts of Biology in that program that are interesting are working with plants and ecology. Especially ALGAE. (Love algae and marine plants like that) But I understand Microbiology deals with this as well? It's the ""Microbiol Ecology"" that fascinated me. How its small scale, but the interactions between their environment and other microorganisms are fascinating. And you can observe it on a faster scale!

It seems like Microbiology is more hands on anyways. Like you can see the results easily out of petri dishes, and while its small scale, results come faster. My university is literally right next door to Grifols, a major biotech manufacturing facility that regularly hires out students, so this is also another part of my status.

It's that, and at my university the Microbiology students are more closely knit and not full of pre-meds(sorry to any in here, but it gets lonely working with pre meds all the time). 

Long story short, in the field of ""bio manufacturing"", and science based fields such as Technical and Medical Writing, all of which I am interested in, would a Microbiology degree benefit me more with a more specific skillset and set of opportunities? 

Of course in the distant future I would like to go to grad school for an MLIS to be a librarian at a university(science librarians are sorely needed and rare I found out), but for now I am focused on a job after graduation. ",microbiology,1450915311,scehood,5,6,True,2015-12-23

12,Question about L. pneumophila MIP / virulence factors,"Hi guys! 

I'm a second year student at a community college currently working on an independent research project surveying water systems around campus for legionella. 

The statistic that gets thrown around a lot is that L. pneumophila is responsible for 90% of the cases of Legionnaire's disease. I guess my questions is: why is this? What are virulence factors that contribute to this? 

Furthermore, one of the most significant virulence factors for pneumophila is the macrophage-infectivity potentiator (MIP). As I understand it, (please correct me if I am wrong!), MIP is a PPIase -- one of a class of enzymes which convert isomers of proline between cis/trans orientation. It is utilized during protein folding(?)  

However, I am confused by the fact that forms of the MIP protein are known to be ubiquitous in the genus legionella -- so what is different/why is it so special in pneumophila? 

Here's a paper I have been slowly digesting. It has sources for a lot of what I've just talked about. 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4187684/#B1

I apologize if this is too specific a question, but I would very much appreciate any clarification you can give! Also, if any of you can recommend papers on legionella, I would love you so very much!

My name is Fenner, and I am leading a talented team developing a simulation game. Why am I on /r/microbiology? It is a 3D, scientifically accurate microbiological simulator where you control and manage a Natural Killer (NK) cell. (If you don't know what a NK cell is, then you are probably not fit for this position :P). 

We are a very relaxed team of six, but at the same time we are very determined to create this project, and we are very passionate about educating people in science. So far the development has been going smoothly; most of the backbone programming has been done, and the designers have a good idea about what the final product will look like. 

We are seeking someone who is very knowledgeable in microbiology, with an extensive understanding of NK cells- someone who is available to work on the team as a scientific consultant. This person will be working closely with the designers to make sure that everything in this product is scientifically accurate, so we can hopefully distribute to schools and universities. You will also work with the 3D artists to ensure that the models they are creating are an accurate representation of that object (for example: organelle structure, protein structure, proportions). You will not need to work full time or a certain amount of hours, but we need someone who is available to answer any microbiology questions on Skype, and occasionally review design documents and visuals. :)

I would love to discuss this project in more detail with you! If you are interested in this position, or have any questions, comments, concerns- feel free to send me a PM, or email me at **fenner@drixygames.net**

Thank you for considering this opportunity to not only share your knowledge, but bring the amazing world of cells and the immune system to life with not just visuals: but with an interactive strategic management simulator aimed to educate people of all ages in microbiology.

The first time was my 4th year of college, and after being rejected by all the programs I turned to reddit. I found a post somewhere that suggested checking out the NIH IRTA program, so I did. I'm really happy about that too, because I'm on my second year of the fellowship and it's been a blast. Maybe I can get some help again?

I applied to grad schools again last Fall, and as you figured from the title, I got rejected from everybody. Maybe not officially rejected, but I checked gradcafe's survey results and interview invites were sent out mid-December. I looked through gradcafe's earlier years, and it looks like invites are only ever sent out mid-December while rejections are handed out throughout January. It was like this for every program I applied to.

I applied for Microbiology or Molecular Biology programs. I started by looking for, and contacting professors (some were the same ones I talked to my first time), and then applying to the programs they took students from. I felt like this was a good way of approaching things, since I knew I would be going into a program where I knew at least one professor who had my research interests (host-microbe biology). Apparently didn't work, lol.
 
I felt like a competitive candidate this time around, and it really sucks to not get in. I really want to continue doing research, and I know getting a PhD is required for that, but I'm honestly feeling discouraged. Maybe this path isn't right for me, and maybe a PhD is too ambitious, but I've been set on it for so long and I feel lost on what I could do next.

I want to apply again, but I still have a whole year of waiting. I'll definitely look into jobs since my fellowship has a 2 year cap (it ends summer 2016), but at this point it feels like research isn't right for me.

36,Is Specimen Processing a good start for a recent Microbiology graduate?,"Hey everyone! I've seen some great advice here, so I thought hey, another similar question to ask!

I'm a very recent graduate with a bachelor's of science in Microbiology. I don't have any lab experience at all and am seeking employment for entry level lab work. I honestly don't think I would be accepted into a grad program because of my GPA, plus the fact I have to commute 30 miles to my University *again* (the closest one). I'm not interested in research, but just a stable job. Just putting that there. Goal: gain lots of lab experience, then get proper licensing/certification for a better job.

Money is running tight for me and I have a student loan I need to pay off. Plus I need to get out of the house and do something productive. I grew tired of being an unemployed student.

But, my parents are on my case saying that a recent job offer as a specimen processor, is not good enough. They think that because I have a bachelor's that I'm supposed to be getting the big bucks. I'm 1st generation born so it's difficult explaining what my major is and what I have to do in order to get a better job.

Ever since the last day of the semester (December 11) I have been staying up till 2 am applying for jobs. I've applied for many jobs and only got 2 call backs. I've also tried a cancer research hospital next to my campus that had research assistant positions (rejected). Most of the jobs I see require 1-2 years lab experience and/or licensing. But the thing is, in order to become a licensed anything, you need experience. And a lot of my professors told me this is where Microbiology graduates start off as and they work their way up with experience, they start off as processing specimens!

The job offer is full-time and everyone seems so nice, it's not one of those temporary part-time jobs. I was also introduced to the Microbiologist who works in the back on urine specimens/blood plates. I know it's not going to be a luxurious job, but it's something. The job involves a lot of sitting down at a computer for data entry on the specimen tubes, and some cleaning, etc.

I understand that I'm far behind those that have chosen to major in this field as undergrads (because I don't have the pre-requisites, in- class lab experience, and lab experience out of class.) So choosing this field now sets me at a large disadvantage, time-wise. After taking a few classes in biology, neuroscience, and chemistry throughout my career, however, I've finally decided to stop wishing I was a science major and just go for it. I'm 100% sure this is the field I want to pursue, so I'm willing to undergo a significant amount of backtracking in order switch focus, with the ultimate goal of conducting research at the graduate level. 

My questions are:

1. Are there any other options for me short of going back to school and getting a second bachelor's before getting lab experience and applying to grad-school? I understand there are two-year second bachelor's programs for certain fields in biology, but does any one know if this type of program exists at any institutions for microbiology? 

2. As an alternative to getting a second bachelor's degree, I've read that it is sometimes possible to fulfill the pre-requisites for grad-school application by taking ad-hoc classes after graduating, while also getting volunteer lab experience. In your opinion, is this a viable option?

3. As an alternative to the ad-hoc pre-requisite path I described above, I've been looking in to postbac pre-med programs, which provide most, if not all, of the pre-requisite classes listed on microbiology grad-school program application sites, with the added guarantee providing out of class lab experience in a more structured schedule. Because it is more structured and offering this experience, would this be a more viable option than the previous two options listed above? 

For a little background in my class history, I've taken four semesters of biology with labs, including one class in microbiology. I've taken one intro chemistry course and one intro neuro course, but I have no physics or math experience.

If it matters, I'm graduating from a highly-ranked liberal arts school with around a 3.65 GPA.

49,Strange Paenibacillus growth for environmental monitoring,"TL;DR:  One colony looks like hundreds.  When a few are acceptable but hundreds are not, how do you tell what was really there?

I've run into a difficult problem when it comes to quantifying the number of CFUs for air monitoring.  [Here](http://imgur.com/gallery/38618un/new) is a picture of one of my test plates (number 16, on the right).  The number of distinct colonies is too high to count, and it looks like a simple case of media contamination or ridiculously high levels of bacteria in the air.

The area I test is not classified at an aseptic level, so growth is normal.  But I tested a lot of samples in nearby areas, at the same time and over the past few months, and the plates didn't look nearly this bad.  I got the organism ID'd, and everytime I've had a plate look like this, the ID is Paenibacillus glucanolyticus.

I've looked up the the genus and research has been done to study strange growth patterns. [Check these out](https://www.google.com/search?q=Paenibacillus+growth&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCm5v2nqrKAhUN4mMKHSbsBrsQ_AUIBygB&amp;biw=1306&amp;bih=813#tbm=isch&amp;q=paenibacillus+vortex) Other species in the genus secrete a fluid during colony formation.  A cell will break off from the colony, swim in the fluid, and resettle on the plate.  It will then form what looks like a completely different CFU.  I can't find studies about this specific species doing the same thing.

Now to explain that plate on the left in the picture-  I touched a loop to one of the colonies on the original plate.  I then lightly touched that loop (No streaking!) to the three spots marked on the plate.  2 days later, and the entire plate is covered in what appears to be hundreds of distinct CFUs.

Now here is my problem-  When you recover organisms that grow like this, how are you supposed to enumerate them in your environment?  Does anyone have experience with this?

We are trying to test the activity of an enzyme these strains have on different substrates. The enzyme is induced by biphenyl.

When we grow these strains on LB agar we have incredibly low activity, if any, and the colonies look much different than if we grow them on MSB + biphenyl agar plates.

We got the stains from a different lab that was growing on biphenyl and some minimal media agar.  When we try to make our own plates, the strains don't grow. So these are my questions:

1) What exactly does Parafilm do?  My lab manager put the freshly streaked plates in our 30 degree with parafilm around them.  She said its to keep the plates hydrated. I've always thought that even though that's beneficial the strain cannot grow well do to a lack of oxygen.  But that was from an intro-lab class.  Could this be a problem?

2)  The literature/recipes I have found for biphenyl plates are simple.  Make MSB media without the metals and vitamins, add some agar, autoclave, add the vitamins and metals, and a biphenyl solution (ground biphenl in MTBE), then pour. The plates came out beautifully, and looked similar to the plates from the other lab, but no growth.

While that is a pain in the butt that means my other data for that strain can't be used, I would like to actually confirm that is what happened.  I designed primers that flank the transposon region, and for a region within the transposon.  The control strain (has the transposon) produces products across flanking regions, and within the transposon, and the suspect strain does not.  Ok, good.  So then I figured I would show that there is a scar in the suspect strain where the transposon should be. I do not know exactly how large this scar would be though, but I imagine within 3kb?

Anyway, PCR using primers from the flanking ends of the transposon region, from regions where the suspect strain still shows normal levels of transcription, does not produce any PCR product.

 I'm a senior Biochemistry major at a private college in Iowa and will have the opportunity to do my private research in April.

I did an internship at Integrated DNA technologies over the summer, so I'm hoping they'll ""sponsor"" me and provide me with the guide DNA for free, but I haven't heard back from them for a few weeks so I'm thinking that may not happen.

100,Trouble with PCR and primer set,"Hello,

I've isolated three potential ∆-candidates for a specific gene in a species of fungus. For the PCR used to identify the ∆-candidates I initially used three sets of primers (UFW/UFR, DFF/DFF, SU/SD) based on [this](http://i.imgur.com/gsEexaU.png) image.

Then of course the final confirmation needs to come from the I1/I2 primer set (see image) with which however I'm having serious trouble;


- I have two sets of DNA; one from the wild type, the other from the ∆-candidate resulting from a transformation.
- For both, I have two primer sets; one for the deletion (which should give a band in the wild type and not for the potential ∆) and one for control (which should give a band in both cases).

The standard solution for the PCR-tubes is 50ul, with 1ul DNA, 1ul PR1, 1ul PR2, 0,2ul dNTP, 5,0ul TAQ-Buffer, 1.5 DMSO, 0,2ul TAQ and the rest Mili-Q. The primer set for the control works perfectly fine with an increased amound of DMSO and no other changes (except the amount of Milli-Q of course). 

The I1/I2 primer set for the ∆ however is excessively problematic;

- I originally tested the I1/I2-primers which were available already but they were terrible (with a CG-percentage of 83%) so I ordered matching new ones with a CG-percentage of 53% and a temperature of 60°C.

However, I still have problems creating clear bands with gel electrophoresis. In all cases I manage to get a vague or nonexisting band for the wild type, and so far nothing for the potential ∆-candicate. Which is fine, but the band quality is so low that I can't use these results of course. On the same gel however, the control primers work perfectly fine. This despite the following changes (in the tubes with the I1/I2-primer set and PCR settings);

* change the amount of DMSO from 0ul up to 5ul (and everything in between).
* change the temperature on the PCR (step 3, 20 sec.) with the used amounts °C being 53, 55, 58, 60 and 62.
* use the primer set without dilution, thus 100mM instead of the regular 10mM.
* made new DNA samples (chromosomal dna isolation) from freshly grown colonies.

Of course, I can order new primers again, but these have been selected carefully and checked personally by my supervisor and the inconsisting (and vague) results might argue that the problem is not with the primers.

So, I would to ask if someone experienced similar problems and ultimately managed to find a solution?

200,"This week in Cell: microbiome significantly affects previously used mouse model of S. typhi infection, potentially rendering model useless","There's two papers in this week's issue of Cell that are well worth reading (especially as they're two pages long each). I've hosted the PDFs myself via Dropbox in the spirit of providing open access, and because great and critical science shouldn't be kept hidden behind a paywall. 

The [first paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5tic48xsm6oj6w6/1-s2.0-S0092867416301179-main.pdf?dl=0) by Song *et al* describes how TLR-11 -/- mice (i.e. removal of TLR-11, the sensor of typhoid fever/*S. typhi*) are **not** susceptible to infection with *S. typhi*. This is a big deal, as this model has been used for nearly a decade's worth of work. 

&gt; In conclusion, five independent laboratories
at four different institutions were unable
to reproduce the reported increased
susceptibility of TLR11-deficient mice to
S. Typhi, and therefore, these animals
cannot serve as a model to study typhoid
fever. The conclusion that species-specific
expression of TLR11 and its binding
to flagellin determines S. Typhi susceptibility
is also questioned by our studies.
Urgent efforts to develop a convenient
animal model for typhoid fever must
therefore continue.

The [second paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r17m0ljvx92dcp6/1-s2.0-S0092867416301222-main.pdf?dl=0) by Mathur *et al.* shows that genetic and phenotypic drift in this mouse model has occurred, leading to variable susceptibility to infection. This change has been tracked back to when the mice were moved from Yale University to Columbia University, and the authors strongly suspect that the shift in the mice's microbiome is responsible based on sequencing data and similar studies published on TLR5 mice in 2007 and 2010. 

&gt; In summary, our current results suggest
a loss of susceptibility to infection relative
to that previously reported. While we
speculate that the phenotype may correlate
with changes in the intestinal flora,
as has been reported for the variable
penetrant phenotypes attributed to loss
of TLR5 (Singh et al., 2015; Vijay-Kumar
et al., 2010; Vijay-Kumar et al., 2007),
further studies will be necessary to fully
test this hypothesis, which may be informative

233,Autoclaving with and without caps screwed tight?,"Colleagues and I were having a discussion about what happens when you autoclave with the caps screwed tight as opposed to not.  Specifically talking about Duran glass 1L bottles, filled with 1L agar or media.

So I've heard the conventional wisdom about the glass breaking if the cap isn't lose, but I think that's rubbish, as there'll be a pressure build-up inside the bottle, and so long as the pressure difference between the inside and the outside aren't *too* different, the bottle will be fine. (So that's why we're told not to microwave these bottles with caps, as the microwave provides no external pressure).

What I'm having difficulty with is the notion that things aren't ""properly"" autoclaved if the cap is tight.  It's said that the pressure doesn't ""get in"" to the bottle, so whatever biological things are destroyed by the pressure won't be if you don't have the cap lose.

I don't think I agree.  I think if the Duran has 1L of water in, and probably a couple hundred mL headspace on top of that, and if the liquid in the bottle is heated to 121˚C by the steam in the autoclave conducting heat to the glass, then there will be a pressure buildup inside the bottle.  And in my mind, the smaller the headspace, the larger the pressure.  

After all, all the autoclave does is heat water in a sealed environment, with the steam providing the pressure.  The liquid inside the Duran will be doing just the same thing.

Has anyone ever measured the pressure inside the Duran as it's autoclaved with different head spaces?  I've tried a little literature search but I can't seem to find anything relevant.  Most of these sources spout the same crap about the glass imploding, which I'm not sure is even correct.

Or anyone with a physics background who can just describe the physics of it without needing to do the empirical work?

234,[Lab Help] Impact of salinity on the rate of decomposition in soils,"So I'm a highschooler faced with a dilemma of practicals in biology. In class we are doing ""mock"" labs for practice and the teacher has given the theme of ""salt"" and are highly recommended to base it on ecology.
I'm interested in the role that salinity plays a part in the decomposition of organic matter; so obviously the independent variable is the concentration of salt in each sample of soil, and the dependent variable is the biomass remaining in each sample. I think the science involved with this has to do with osmosis, but please correct me if I'm wrong. So what I have so far is this:

* Samples will be isolated in separated petri dishes with controlled environmental conditions

* I will dissolve the salt in a controlled volume of water, doing the same for each independent variable, and mixing the different concentrations in each sample

* I will use a grater to grate controlled masses of potato (organic matter) and place it in each sample

* Leave for a time period and measure biomass of each sample; then do the analysis

And thats what I have so far. To measure the biomass, I would possibly dry it out, or use a muffler oven as I have researched link but I have no idea whether it will work. So some questions I would like to ask are:

*Will my current ""method"" will give me results? If not may you give some hints to my mistakes?

*Is my setup correct?

*Is there any alternatives to the organic matter used ( I researched and they used manure and other stuff, which we don't have.)

*Will a potato skin make any difference to the rate of decomposition (for ecological validity)?

*How long should I leave the samples for?

*Do I need to put a control among the samples?

*And whether my usage of the independent and dependent variable is correct

As you can tell, I am very nervous about this. Its my first time doing a lab with micro-organisms and possibly fungi, and I am both excited and scared by this. My teacher never heard of this experiment before and she can't give any assistance, which I understand with my choice of topic.

236,I was hoping for some help with a few questions about cell counting using spectrophotometry and accounting for non-viable cell.,"I've posted this to /r/askscience and /r/biology already, but didn't have much luck. Maybe you guys could help?

So I'm working on a project right now, and we are using spectrophotometers (along side dilution plates) to measure the growth, stationary phase, and death phase of a bacterial culture in broth.  I was wondering how to account for the death of bacteria using an indirect cell counting method.
    

We used a spectrophotometer to shoots a beam of light at 620nm through the turbid specimen.  The light then diffracts off of the cells leaving the remaining light to be picked up by the sensor.  That makes sense, but what doesn't make sense to me is that dead bacteria should also diffract the light to a certain extent.  Is there a specific wavelength that will pick up their turbidity with any accuracy?  Do they diffract the light in a manner similarly to how viable cells would?
    


We noticed that the absorbance increased and decreased when we tested it, but I didn't expect it to jump around as much as it did since we were testing it's absorbance every 15 minutes.  Shouldn't we expect that - at least for a good length of time - the absorbance would only increase as cells multiplied, died, and added to the overall biomass?  I could see how over a long period of time, when they move into the death phase, the turbidity would lower, but it shouldn't ever reach the blanks level of clarity even if every cell is dead.  
    
So my main questions are: 

* When using a spectrophotometer to indirectly count the number of cells, am I only really measuring its total biomass, and not the amount of viable and non-viable cells?

* Is there any, rather standard, wavelength that will account for non-viable cells?

* And wouldn't I expect - during the log and stationary phases - the absorbance to only increase?

* Should I interpret the significant decreases followed by increases in absorbance be caused by errors (i.e. user error, calibration/maintenance problems with the spectrophotometer, not agitating the specimen before testing in a consistent manner, random error, etc.)?

Thanks for any help on this matter.

There are two sides to our current debate. One is that gloves should be worn constantly in the lab, the other is that gloves should only be worn at your bench when protecting yourself or your sample and not used to touch surfaces that you don't wipe down afterwards.

My view is the latter. I think if you use gloves all the time it leads to contamination of all surfaces in the lab which I would regard as bad practice. However I completely acknowledge that wearing gloves all the time can protect the operator from hand contamination if everyone is not adhering to the same standard but to me that is a training issue.

What differences would this result in for the outcomes of the plates after the KB test is performed?

I was thinking that the zones of inhibition would be larger in the plate that used culture A as it had less time to grow and therefore less bacteria of which more would be killed by the same amount of antibiotic. I was also thinking that the lawn of bacteria outside of the zones of inhibition would be more thick in the plate where culture B was applied for the same reason.

307,Question about growth curves,"Hello! I am doing a rotation in a microbio lab studying MRSA and we have 8 strains that we need to do growth curves for. I am on my 3rd time repeating this experiment. The first time, half the plates were bad and nothing grew (I didn't realize 1 month was enough for the TSA plates to go bad). The second time, I redid the experiments but the colonies I streaked out for every timepoint were not consistently increasing (I didn't realize vortexing ~5 seconds was not enough time vortexing before plating. I was told afterwards to vortex each dilution at least 15 seconds before plating to break up clumps of bacteria). The third time, my results did not recapitulate the former technicians results - the CFUs were off by an order of magnitude. 

It is required of me to do an 8-hour time course taking measurements every 30 minutes, and for each of the 17 timepoints (including T0), doing 4 x 10 fold serial dilutions and plating them.

When I start my fourth time doing this experiment over again, I have to dilute an overnight culture to 0.1 OD and take that as timepoint 0. At this point, can I vortex and mix the large 0.1 OD culture really well and split it into 17 different tubes and just take 1 out every 30 minutes and throw it away when I'm done with it? I'm not sure if this is a sound experimental thing to do since it may introduce more variability, but another part of me feels like this is the better way to do it instead of pulling 1 culture tube out 17 times from the incubator, vortexing, and going in and out of the tube 17 times to take all my timepoints.

TLDR: When figuring out CFUs, do you have to measure from  1 culture or can you initially split that culture over as many tubes as timepoints you have to take.

326,Some questions related to prions.,"Hello microbiologists,

over the last few days I started to learn more and more about prions and there were a few question I can't answer with just online research. Maybe some of you can give me some insights.

- Prions are bound to metal when they come in touch with stuff like scarpels or medical equipment. Is a contermination possible only related to brain tissue (since the only reports were from brain surgerys) or is it possible that for example in a slaughterhouse all meat can be cross infected by just one cow carry the infevtive prion ? (using the same knifes to cut the meat)

- A japanese professor found small traces of the PRP^sc prion in salvia, blood and milk from cattles. Does someone know if it's possible to get the disease from milk ? (I knew from the scrapie disease where it was found in milk as well. But even after showing infectios prions in milk the open statement is ""milk is save"") It was a scientific paper published in 2012.

- When there were cases that the disease was transfered due to blood donations why does the most commom statement is that milk and especially blood of cows won't contain prions.

- If it's possible to get the disease from milk wouldn't we live at a high risk cause mostly milk is stored in big milk silos. So one infective prion could infect the whole milk.

- The variant found in deer (cwd) is known to be found in salvia, excrements and so on from infected animals. Also is shown that prions can bound to soil and other plants. So does this mean we can possible infected by esting a vegan diet ? (I know that cwd isn't possible to infect humans).

- If all or some of the above is true would that mean that we can be infected with them quite easily but there must be some kind of resistence in most people ? 

It's an interesting topic but I feel most open comments are calming down the real issues or stating wrong facts. Hope someone can enlighten me.

365,Graduate school or Lab Tech?,"I'm currently in the middle of deciding on whether or not I should go to graduate school or seek a lab technician job out of college to gain additional experience. To elaborate on this I'm currently a college senior double majoring in chemistry and biology. I applied to five graduate programs (all microbiology), was fortunate enough to get interviews with three of them but that was were my luck ended. After being rejected by four of the programs I realized that my odds with the last program probably weren't that great and started applying and looking into technician jobs.

This Monday however, I finally heard back from the last program to find that I had been accepted. Honestly I had applied to this program as a fall back, but its by no means a bad program. The problem is that after interviewing with the other programs I feel like they have more to offer than the program I was accepted to does. Now I'm currently in a position where I have a week to decide whether or not I want to accept the admission into the program. My question is do I accept the admission and attend the program, knowing that it is a good program, or choose to not accept and work a lab tech job for a year and then apply to a greater number of programs next year in the hopes of getting into a program that I feel is more in line with my interests?

I've talked with several of my professors about this and it's a pretty even split with half of them thinking I should accept the offer and the other half saying that getting the additional experience and then reapplying would likely result in more offers from different programs. 

Just for some background information I have a solid GPA (~3.9), with a decent amount of research experience, in both bio and chem, for someone who attended a very small liberal arts school. I did a microbiology REU last summer, and hopefully towards the end of the summer will have a first authorship on a paper for my chemistry research. 

Would getting a lab tech job, potentially at one the university's programs I'm interested in, make that much more of a difference if I did re-apply to programs next year? Or with admissions to PhD micro programs being so competitive am I better accepting the offer from the program I got into? 

Sorry, this post turned out to be longer than I had anticipated. I appreciate any thoughts you all could offer. I'm leaning towards accepting the offer, but I still want to weigh my options before I commit to a path.

tl;dr: Admitted into graduate program, not sure if I should accept or get a tech job for experience and re-apply next year with the aim of getting into my dream program. ",microbiology,1460064542,solus17,9,3,True,2016-04-07

My main question is, how are VLPs different than viral vectors such as AAV and retroviruses? 

Based on my knowledge:

- VLPs are produced by expressing coat proteins, which self-assemble into VLPs. Viral vectors are expressed as a whole virion particles. 

- VLPs do not carry the viral genome; viral vectors carry the viral genome. (Doesn't the viral genome get replaced by the gene of interest before entering the cells?)

376,Please help an idiot - Vacuum sealing and C. botulinum / L. monocytogenes,"**Hi everyone!**   
To make a (very) long story short: I bought a vacuum sealer so I could stop being fat, and I kinda fucked it all up..   
Oh well; That won't do. I'll explain...   
So, a while back I discovered /r/mealprepsunday , and figuring that both I and my fiancee work full shifts (and got 2 small children), we would benefit from prepping all our upcoming weeks dinners and just reheating them when we got off work... We are also trying to apply ourselves to the keto-lifestyle and to avoid carbs...   
Lunchtime at work is always difficult (you can only eat so many eggs), so I also figured ""what the hell; lets also prep all our  lunches on sundays!)...   
My storage room looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/gRgizRQ.jpg) (all the boxes now having labels), so you can tell why I was attracted to the idea of rows upon rows of neatly packed, delicious foodstuffs in identical containers in the fridge...   
But there is a problem here... Shelf life for prepared food (in the fridge) isn't really more than a few days, and even if it's edible after that it kinda gets mushy and yucky.... After contemplating this a while I came up with a 100% perfect solution. Vacuum!... It's the damned oxygen's fault that the food spoils, right? Just get rid of those lousy bastards and  everything will be fine! Right!?   
So, living up to my ""all-in""-image, I promptly went online and ordered 1400 Euros (1600 USD) worth of [vacuum-sealer-stuff](http://i.imgur.com/nFbLaFG.jpg). Nobody else is enough of a special snowflake to order that much vacuum-thingymajangs, so they didn't have enough boxes in store. [The last batch came in last week](http://i.imgur.com/mOTcQMp.jpg), making my total number of containers 22 (10x 1000ml for lunches, 7x 2000ml for small dinners, and 5x 3200ml for large ones)...      
Initially i was very happy with my decision, and I made [this](http://i.imgur.com/9uSaGRz.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/bC7QEMb.jpg)!... It amounted to 6 dinners for my family, of which I put one each in the fridge, and the other 4 in the freezer (-18c).   
So far so good... But; enter the protagonists of this story; C. *botulinum* / L. *monocytogenes*.   
Apparently Those nasty buggers kill you (and your children), if you let them sit around and have filthy sex and produce toxins in your foods' oxygen-deprived atmosphere at fridge temperatures... Yikes!...   
Not wanting to be responsible for my children's premature deaths I went online, and spent quite a few hours reading about those bacteria, and about food handling SOP's (cleanliness, pressure-cooking, quick-chilling, storage conditions etc.).   
***My conclusions are as follows:***   
- One has to assume that these bacteria are present in basically all our ingredients.   
- The bacteria are killed at approx 100c, but the spores survives temperatures exceeding 120c, requiring a pressure cooker to kill them off properly. I prefer my meats cooked to approximately 65-70C, so this isn't really an option for making tasty dinners.   
- The bacteria and spores are dormant at freezer-temperatures, and can safely be stored at -18c for at least 3 years.   
- At 2C in the fridge, the vacuumed food is safe for a maximum of 72 hours before having to be discarded.   
- Hot, prepared food has to be quick chilled and reach the storage temperature within 6 hours of cooking. This is to minimize the time spent in the ""temperature window"" where the bacteria is most active.   
- It is possible to increase the shelf life of the food substantially if you utilize a ""second barrier""; by controlling water activity levels (higher than Aw 0.85) and pH-level (higher than 4.5), or just go all in and radiate the hell out of everything... None of those are really an option due to convenience and cost...
   
So... Here I am... I have tons of vacuum-equipment that I don't really know what to do with...   
My initial plan to prepare a weeks worth of food (10 lunches and 5-7 dinners) doesn't really work out since I can only keep the sealed food in the fridge for a maximum of 3 days, and even then I have to deal with the hassle of quick-chilling it... I then figured that I would keep the first 3 days of food in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer.   
I did however notice that the vacuum was gone from some of the containers I already put in the freezer, and inquired with the shop... Apparently the containers are not intended for freezing with vacuum applied even if they are stamped with ""-30c to 120+c""...
So thats not really an option either it seems (I have sent off an email to the factory asking for confirmation of this)...   

**So... What now?**   
Is there a way ""around this""?   
Am I being ""too cautious""?   
Why are some sources saying that I can safely vacuum-store stuff like nuts, lettuce, flour, rice, soups, cookies etc. in the fridge when I've read that it can be dangerous?   
I would really appreciate some insight on the matter from professionals :-) I've asked around quite a bit in other food-related subreddits/fora, and after giving me the obvious answers (""it can be dangerous"". ""You should follow a proper SOP""), it kinds boils down to the fact that nobody really understands the matter and I should ask elsewhere.. So here I am :-)   
   
Some of the sources I've relied on so far:   
- [Health officials notes for a lecture](http://www.mda.state.mn.us/Global/MDADocs/food/foodsafety/mod-vacpack/vacpack-speaker_notes.aspx)   
- [HAACCP-based SOP for quick-chilling](http://sop.nfsmi.org/HACCPBasedSOPs/CoolingPHF.pdf)   
- [British Food Standards Agency' guidelines for vacuum packaged chilled food guidance](http://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdfs/publication/vacpacguide.pdf)   
   
***Edit:***
- I got confirmation from La-va (the manufacturer of the vacuum machine/containers), that the containers are indeed suitable for freezing, and;
- I noticed that the british FSA guideline [fact-sheet](http://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdfs/publication/vacpack0708.pdf) states that VP/MAP-foods can be stored for up to 10 days without the extra controls mentioned earlier in the post...

I am a senior majoring in Microbiology about to graduate in May.

My self confidence took a hit, but the lab manager in the research lab I work in now gave my CV to a man she works with who cofounded a biotechnology startup company. I talked on the phone with him about possibly being hired on as a lab manager over at his startup lab. It sounds like an exciting opportunity, and we have a meeting scheduled for later this month to talk about the position more.
However, just yesterday, the man in charge of the research lab I am in now offered to let me stay in his lab and start a Master's program under him, and also said he could get me a GTA position my first year, and a GRA position for the second year, also that my tuition would be free. This professor is very established and well-known in my field and would provide a lot of networking opportunities as well. 
So this is my decision I have to make: immediately jump into grad school after getting my Bachelor's, taking no time off (I would still work for him over the summer), or take a year or so off and work for a start up company as a lab manager which would probably pay substantially more than being a GTA or GRA, but this would mean I'd have to reapply to grad school after next year. 
I'm just looking for any insight really from those in the field.

421,Mapping lac operon?,"http://i.imgur.com/mvhjjDW.png

Hey there! I'm trying to understand the concept of this particular instance to no avail. I get some of the rules like how an I^s mutation mean no induction on either operon and how the O^c mutation is constitutive...etc., but there are certain nuances that I just don't get.

For the 2nd line (1st empty one), I'm thinking it's + + - -  because there's no repressor, but I feel like I'm missing something.

For the 3rd line, I think it's - + - + due to the fact that the Operator is constitutive and the first operon doesn't have an operator at all.

What is confusing is that, this varies significantly in Darwinian selection since there are no mutations. As in, this isn't bacteria with mutated flagella being at a benefit, but *changing* the flagella upon exposure which is happening.

We commonly make them competent by growth to mid-exponential phase (OD600 = 0.6), iterations of coldwash in ~~PBS~~ 10 % glycerol or dH2O followed by electroporation, this works 1/5 times. 

We are looking for a transformation technique that works just as good as TSB (transformation storage buffer) transformations in the commensal K12 strain. 

Any ideas or tips is thus much appreciated!

I'm trying to solve a course-problem related to finding the DNA mutation rate in a normally growing cell culture.

There are two parts to the question I do not understand how to go about, searching via Google hasn't given me anything I feel actually applies to my problem:

1) How to analysis and determine how many mutations occurred in   5kb of a specific gene.

2) From said previous analysis method the frequency of base changes (per billion bp) for each of a dozen different plates that were initially seeded with 1000 cells were determined. Assuming the rate of mutation is constant, explain the variation in the frequency of mutations identified other than experimental error.

I’m writing this post for some advices regarding the career prospect of a Bsc microbiologist.
I graduated last year with a Bsc specializing in microbiology, I’ve been working in various university labs as a research student for over two years. After my graduation, I’ve been lucky enough to land a sweet gig at one of my university’s lab which lasted a few months before I got laid off due to funding cut.  Ever since then I am unable to find anything remotely related to my field. My original plan was to enroll in a graduate program after my bachelor’s degree, but I’ve since talked to a lot of professors, post-docs, pHD and masters students, the career prospects of an academia researcher appears to be very discouraging and unstable, and does not bridge well with the industry work.

At the moment, I’m very confused about the next step that I should take in order to build a career in microbiology. I have applied to another bachelor in medical laboratory science. However, The entrance requirement in my home province is rather. I’d be really grateful if I made it into the program, but I’ve heard some very negative opinions from people in the field, that the work gets very repetitive, and offers little opportunities for both scientific learning and career advancement, so I’m not really sure if that’s what I wanted to do for the long term.

Dear redditors, what would you suggest that I do for my next step? I am still passionate about research, and I’d like to eventually end up in a career related to microbiology.

There is this medicine that is used to ""improve"" the immune system. I was reading an article about it, and it said what I mentioned in the title, and I was wondering if that meant the drug could also potentially prevents Candida Albicans (Thrush infections) in people. 

This is the excerpt that is interesting: 

""(DCs = Dendritic Cells) IF-S inhibits C. albicans and A. fumigatus binding to human DCs.Given the origin of the polysaccharide moiety of AM3 (IF-S), we initially set up an experiment to analyze whether IF-S could affect the capture of pathogenic strains of Candida by DCs. IF-S inhibited the binding of C. albicans to human MDDCs in a dose-dependent manner and to a similar extent as a function-blocking anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1A and C). Furthermore, IF-S also diminished the number of fungi bound per cell, as evidenced by the reduction of the mean fluorescence intensity of the cell population (Fig. 1B). Besides, IF-S reduced the binding of A. fumigatus conidia to human MDDCs in a dose-dependent manner, and the degree of inhibition was comparable to that obtained with equivalent concentrations of S. cerevisiae mannan or with a blocking antibody against DC-SIGN antibody (Fig. 1D). Therefore, the polysaccharide component of AM3 inhibits the DC-SIGN-dependent binding of C. albicans and A. fumigatus to MDDCs.""

http://aac.asm.org/content/51/7/2313.full

So to conclude, does this mean the use of this drug could prevent/help get rid of Candida Albicans infections causing Thrush? 

If DCs kill the fungus, then it looks like the medicine would actually HELP the C. Albicans fungus and worsen infections because it prevents DC binding with C. Albicans (I am a complete noob this is noob reasoning). Is this true?

Edit 1: https://imgur.com/a/gsKwY

See gallery for some shitty phone pictures. Some slightly better pictures coming later - I don't think the gram stain pictures are very telling tbh.

Hi guys!

Recently in my lab we found some mystery colonies of tiny (? 1mm) *somethings* growing on coronal mouse brain sections. These sections were old and stored in (apparently, possibly not though) 0.01% sodium azide at 4°C. *I do not have a very strong microbiology background*, but as I'm sort of bottom bitch at the moment (I'm paid well for it so I can't complain) I offered to help identify it and see if we could get rid of it. Another preface: chances are the tissue is unusable now anyway so it's probably a fruitless endeavour.

**What I've tried to do to identify it so far:**

- Stained with DAPI (nuclear stain) initially just to take a look at it. Positive reaction indicates it obviously has nuclear material, but appeared to show lots of very small cocci (maybe 1-2 microns in diameter).

- Initial Gram stain appeared Gram positive, though cell morphology appeared to be somewhere between a rod and a cocci. Local micro post-doc also wasn't sure.

- Plated up on LB agar and Chocolate (heated blood) agar. Nothing on either after 24 hours but after 48 hours: Lots of small (~1-2mm), circular, flat dome shaped yellow colonies grew. Gram stain of *these* was inconclusive - cells sort of looked like paired short rods, with either strong gram positive, strong gram negative, or both positive and negative areas appearing on the same cells (or capsules or whatever they should be called). At this point I was leaning towards some kind of mycobacteria based on the LB and gram stain.

Chocolate agar plate at *room temp* grew quicker than the one at 35°C which was weird, but perhaps telling as whatever is growing was doing so at a rather low temperature. The colonies on the chocolate agar *also looked different* to those on the LB agar: I couldn't see distinct colony boundaries, and instead saw white dimple-shaped growths or simply grainy white growths where I had streaked or dotted the plate.

I'm hoping some of you might have a better idea of what this could be than I do! I can provide pictures once I'm not on my phone, though the image capturing software I'm using is a little crap and was playing up for me so they aren't very good pictures.

Also happy to field questions. Next step would be an acid fast stain and go from there but as this is a side project of my own interest more so than actual work I can't do much on it at the moment.

I'm in a micro lab and we are doing our final unknown lab. My ""patient"" is a college student with 4 roommates all of whom share food and have vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea.  So my first guess here is food poisoning.  

""Samples"" from the patient were inoculated on nutrient agar and formed LARGE, white, irregular-edged colonies.  Gram (+), single/diplo/streptobacillus arrangement, Endospore Former, Non-Acid-Fast, Catalase (-).  These are the tests and stains I've done so far.  Tomorrow I will grow in a reducing medium, blood agar, and test for glucose.

So all of this leads me to suspect food poisoning by *Clostridium perfringens*, but as I recall, it's an anaerobe, so how would growth on nutrient agar be possible in normal growth conditions (aerobic; 48 hours; 37 C)?  From what I've studied so far, the only endospore formers of medical importance is *Bacillus* and *Clostridium* but *Bacillus* is catalase (+).  Am I missing other possibilities?

634,Cell Count Clarification,"I would like some clarification about cell counts with a hemocytometer.

I'm counting yeast cells so from what I understand I need to be in the middle square which has 5x5 (25) squares. I have been counting the four corner squares and one centre square then averaging out my cell count (eg. 30 + 32 + 33 + 28 + 24 / 5 = 29.4) then using that number to work out my cell density. 

Because I'm using the small squares in the centre I read one of those is 1mm x 1mm x 0.1mm = 0.0001mL.

I have been diluting 1 part of yeast with 9 parts of water (dilution factor of 10?) then one part of the diluted solution with another 9 parts of water (dilution of 100?) 

So my calculation should be:

29.4 x 100 = 2,940 / 0.0001mL = 29,400,000 cells/mL

x 10,000mL of slurry = 294,000,000,000 yeast cells in total?

Are my calculations correct? Or have I misunderstood the hemocytometer or dilution factor? I have read a bit online but not being science/maths minded I get left behind a little and I am really keen to get this right and learn a little more about lab work and microbiology in general. Thanks.

*Edit*: I think I got the squares wrong, the dimensions of the small squares in the centre square are 0.2mm x 0.2mm x 0.1mm = 0.000004mL I now believe. So it would be:

29.4 x 100 = 2,940 / 0.000004mL = 735,000,000 cells/mL

x 10,000mL = 7,350,000,000,000 cells in total slurry.",microbiology,1466594913,notsomicroman,8,3,True,2016-06-22

691,How do you tell if cocci is motile or not?,"Today i was handed an unknown test tube with 2 different types of bacteria in it. To start off i did the gram stain and discovered i had gram negative rods, and gram positive cocci, cool. Now on to the motility test. I used the hanging drop technique and could clearly see that the rods were motile, but i left the lab still debating whether the cocci was motile or not. On the gram stain, all of the cocci were in clumps, so when i am checking for motility, should i only be looking at the clumps, or should i be looking for single cocci floating around?

regardless of whether i'm looking at the clumps or single cocci, what kind of motility am i even looking for? I was told it would be a spinning motion, but does that mean spinning in place and not really moving from a single point, or spinning around in small circles?

698,Recently graduated with a Microbiology degree in the Midwest. Where should I go from here?,"I'm unsure if this is the proper place to post such things, but I figure there's got to be enough successful people in this sub to give me some pointers.

So I graduated from Michigan State last year with a decent GPA in Microbiology. Unfortunately, I came out to my family that year, which resulted in a lot of family stress, a dive in my schoolwork and my research assistantship, and a general scramble to find something, anything, to support myself and my partner with, since returning home was no longer an option. I'm rather ashamed to say this resulted in a strained relationship with my former PI, who I haven't heard from since graduation and who I'm frankly nervous to reach out to.

I was lucky enough to find a Dose Formulations technician position willing to relocate me to Wisconsin, but after a year it became apparent that 3rd shift and the workload were not agreeing with my Type I diabetes, and I wound up resigning a couple months ago.

During the last two months I've submitted maybe a couple hundred applications, and while I've had some promising interviews, I've been rejected on all counts. Is there a strategy I should be employing, or employers I should be targeting? Should I be going back to school for my Master's? I know I can get myself back on my feet and doing some good again, but I'm totally lost as to how.

I had several unexpected surgeries and 2 ED visits (totally unlike me) in the past 6 months, have been on multiple courses of antibiotics and am just recovering from C. diff (Took Flagyl).

Hand Hygiene: I was reading that Chlorhexidine Gluconate is one of the best handwashes, and Triclosan does Ok. I found one that has 0.3%. Does it really matter?      


Environmentally, I realize that I need to use 10% bleach on every surface possible that is compatible. I am also laundering everything with either bleach or hot water and the longest drying cycle.    


Second to Bleach, Hydrogen peroxide based disinfectants tend to provide *some* log reduction, but are not sporicidal. Quats are ineffective.     


Does anyone have any advice/input for infection control in the home environment? The purpose is to prevent a recurrence by re-contamination. I am recovering from it (and have of course been seen and treated by an MD).    


I am not asking for medical advice, just some help on environmental disinfection and/or prevention.

Hello

In the study ""Reduced diversity and altered composition of the gut microbiome in individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome"" https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-016-0171-4

the following bacteria is mentioned ""ME/CFS microbiota were enriched with an unclassified member of the Desulfohalobacteriaceae"". I can only find reference this microbe relating to this study.


Does this mean that Desulfohalobacteriaceae is a member of the family Halobacteriaceae? If so what does the Desulfo mean? Or else in what sense is it unclassifed ?

Many thanks

823,Taking over a project as an undergrad?,"Hi everyone! I wanted to ask y'all for a little advice if you'd be willing to offer it. 

I'm a third-year undergraduate student, and I've been working in the same research lab for about three semesters now (this upcoming semester will be the start of my fourth). My mentor who has been with me throughout this time is leaving in a month to take a job elsewhere--in his absence, he says that I will be taking over his project. It is a completely different project than the one he and I have been working on for the past several semesters. According to him, I will be completely independent -- our lab only has a PI and a graduate student with her own undergrad. It sounds like I'll be completely without a mentor, and that it'll be completely up to me to keep this entire project running and producing data so my PI can write grants for it. He has already told me that this will require a lot of time on my part, especially including time on the weekends. 

As an undergraduate student, I really am not certain that I am ready for or even want to take on this new development. I know I would have the opportunity to learn a lot, but I do not feel exactly ready for the time commitment and pressure of having this new responsibility riding squarely on my shoulders as I try to balance my heavy coursework. I feel like I'm being fed to the wolves with having no mentor and no one else to rely on. Personally, I feel it is a bit unfair of him to ask me as an undergraduate student to take on so much. I'm not a grad student.

Jump forward -- I am reading my textbook and it says ""Prokaryotic cells *typically* do not have a membrane bound nucleus"". 

So, between the book and what my teacher said, I actually have to ask, is there something to this? Are there examples of bacteria or others prokaryotes that have nuclei or membrane bound structures? I always thought the two were mutually exclusive. I thought eukaryotes were defined by a nucleus and membrane bound organelles, and that prokaryotes were defined by a lack of these things. WTF is going on?

852,Bacterial inoculation on vegetables,"Experiment aim: To inoculate 10^3-10^4 CFU/ml of Salmonella on kale leaves and to monitor its survival on the leaves.

What I’ve done: Obtained a glycerol stock of salmonella and used it to perform a 16 streak on an agar plate. Using a sterile loop, 1 colony is obtained from the agar plate and inoculated in 10 ml of Heart infusion broth (HI) and then placed in an incubator at 30C overnight. The following day, I performed serial dilutions of the HI broth( 1ml of HI broth with inoculated culture into seven tubes containing 0.1% peptone water) and then plated onto XLD agar. Using this method I found out that the initial bacterial count of salmonella was 10^8 CFU/ml.

Now, I want to inoculate 10^3- 10^4 CFU/ml onto the kale leaves. Following the same steps as above (inoculating one colony in HI broth overnight), if I want 10^3 CFU/ml, diluting my overnight (108) to    10^-5 (as in 5 dilutions of tubes containing 0.1% peptone water) should give me 10^3 correct? Am I understanding it correctly? I don’t have access to a spectrophotometer so I can’t adjust bacterial concentration using turbidity.

Kale leaves: The kale leaves are first cleaned with water in order to remove any dirt. I’m weighing out 10 g of leaves and placing them in a sterile bag. The bag is then treated under UV light on each side for 5 mins each in order to reduce any naturally present microflora. Following this, 10 ml of HI broth (containing the salmonella culture that has been serially diluted to 10^-5) is poured into the bag and shaken for 2mins. The bag is then left to sit for 30 mins in order to allow the salmonella to attach to the kale leaves. After 30 mins, the 10 ml of broth is poured out.

90 ml of 0.1% peptone water is then poured into the bag to give a 1:10 dilution (Am I correct in assuming this?) and then mixed in a stomacher for 1 min. Then I do serial dilutions, where more tubes are filled with 0.1% peptone water and 1ml is taken from the bag and into the first tube, then 1 ml from 1st tube into second and so on. I’m then taking 0.1 ml from each tube and plating them on XLD agar. My plate counts should indicate an answer of 10^3 CFU/ml had been inoculated on the leaves, however, for some reason my plates are showing no bacterial growth. I’m very confused as to where I’m going wrong. Would anyone be able to provide any insight into this? I would really appreciate some guidance

All kinds of paranoid thoughts are given birth by the billions of neurons firing simultaneously . I realise I fucked up. My hands were still wet/humid ( too spooked to recall correctly). That means if the water was contaminated ( even though it goes thru fuck ton of I dont know sand filters ) I may have just killed myself, by giving the brain rapist a path to my brain. It can use the olfactory nerve as a motherfucking highway. Panic is slowly overcoming. Blow my nose as powerful as I can. Shit hurts, but my mind knows its for the greater good. Put 2 soapy wet wipes up my nostrils and start cleaning the tubes. Burns so much. I did all I can to save myself at this point.

965,MIC 206 student here again. Need help with Filtration Assessment Calculations?,"E-mailed my lab prof, no response. Tutoring is on Sunday and this lab is due tonight. My lab partner doesn't even know how to do her part (Standard Plate Count) so I'm going to have to finish hers as well by the end of tonight. (And I work in four hours.) Again, not looking for answers, but some guidance on how I can find the correct answer so I can learn and not get handouts and apply what I've learned in the future. 


We keep getting confused at this part of the lab:

[Picture](http://imgur.com/a/Vxi4Q)

A.  (1) From the picture above, calculate the number (in CFU) of total coliforms in the 5 mL sample of the water.  Be sure to include units in your answer. 


Answer? 23 colonies x 5 = number of coliforms per 5 mL sample
115 CFU/5mL
 

*******At first I just used 23 colonies, but then didn't know if I needed to include the 5mL so I got confused. In B I just did the 23 times 20 so I got 460CFU/100mL. I'm not sure which is right, and I've been looking at the problems too long to try to understand it :( 

 

B.   (2) Now, calculate the concentration (in CFU/100 mL) of total coliforms in the 5 ml water sample.  Our standard for reporting is CFU/100mL.  Since you have only filtered 5 mL, you have to calculate the number of organisms in 100 mL.  There are two ways to do this: (1) use the formula in the protocol, or (2) consider that 100 mL is 20 X greater than 5 mL.  Be sure to include units in your answer. 


Answer? (115CFUx20) 2,300CFU/100mL



So then I really get goofed up on this question:



1.     (2) Another group of students (group 3) sampled water from a different source.  They diluted 100 mL of water sample with 900 mL of sterile water.  Then now filtered 100 mL of the diluted sample through a membrane filter.  Upon incubation on mFC plate they saw 200 blue colonies.  Calculate the CFU/100 mL of the original water sample.  SHOW YOUR WORK.  Compare their results to the one obtained in group 1. 

There are two ways to do this problem (b is easier for most people):

a.      First, calculate the number (CFU) in the original sample:  if they saw 45 colonies, then there were 45 colonies in 100 ml of the diluted sample.  However, that was only 1/10 of the original sample, since it was diluted 100/1000 (the bottom number is the total volume after dilution – in this case: 100ml + 900ml = 1000ml).  So, the original sample had 10 times as many colonies – or 450 CFU.  Then, calculate the concentration in the original sample:  450 CFU/100 ml.

b.     First, calculate the concentration (CFU/ml) of the diluted sample.  if they saw 45 colonies, then there were 45 colonies in 100 ml of the diluted sample or 45 CFU/100ml.  Then, figure out the dilution that was made:  100ml sample added to 900ml sterile water:  100ml/(100ml + 900ml) = 100ml/1000ml = 1/10.  To back calculate the original concentration, you simply invert that fraction: 10/1 or 10  and multiply that by the number of colonies on the plate (45):  10 x 45 = 450 CFU/100 ml

(There’s more info about these type of calculations in the next protocol – Standard Plate Counts.)



Answer? Because I feel if there's 200 counted in the 100mL diluted sample, you'd use this calculation: 
200CFU / 100mL x 100 = which then you'd just get 200CFU/100mL so it would be the exact same??????

About the chemotactic process I could find more info. Despite having to be exposed to high dense genetic notation, chemotactic signal transduction seems to be a hot topic, which help me understand the flagella dynamics. But I still miss simple drawing explaining where the 'sensors' are located, for instance, and how resource gradient is felt, by spatial or time comparison. 

About nutrient consumption, I actually have no idea if it occurs all around the bacteria, if it occurs all the time or punctuated in time and what it eats.

I got some of the fresh salsa in one of those plastic containers at the store Saturday. It got squished a bit on the conveyor belt with the other groceries while I was checking out but looked fine once the dent was popped out.

I had a few, maybe 3 or 4 chips with some on it because I was trying to figure out if it was just my imagination or perhaps too much cilantro or just the spice of the peppers. Now I'm sort of scared though. I have a pretty big phobia of being sick, and I'm also worried about perhaps botulism (though I read it has a hard for the bacterium that causes it to grow in acidic environments). I figure even if the container got air in it somehow when it got crushed a bit, it still wouldn't have gone bad just since Friday and it's well within it's expiration date. Kind of freaking out because I'm awful and neurotic. Should I worry about any sort of illness with it? Should I be concerned about botulism?

I am a MT (medical technologist) who is debating between two job positions. I received an offer yesterday that was pretty good money, 3rd shift and local as a generalist. The downsides of this position is 3rd shift and the movement up the ladder there is slow, like 3 years before I see 2nd shift slow. I am in the running for a position (job b) at a larger hospital, 1st or 2nd shift in the microbiology department with the possibility to specialize in minimal time (3 years work). The disadvantage for position b is that it is an hour and a half away from where I currently live with my boyfriend and the pay is slightly less than job a. Sorry for the long story precluding my question, but what I am asking is as a MLS what advantages does specialization offer me over just working as a MLS in a micro lab?

72,Dogs and harmful Bacteria,"Hi there

People always make a big fuss about hygiene. You gotta wash your hands before your meals, you shouldn´t eat stuff off the floor, etc, etc, etc, etc.

Now, the thing is, most people, when they have a DOG, they take that dog outside for a walk. That dog steps on all kinds of shit you can find in the street. He even steps on other dog´s shit.

So, most dog´s paws are actually full of shit and nasty bacteria. And many of them sleep on beds, couches, chairs, and walk around every single place we normally touch.

So, by having a dog jumping on your couch on a daily basis, your couch is going to accumulate nasty bacteria over time, unless you´re constantly cleaning it, wich i doubt most people do. Germs from the street, germs from the shit of other animals. And we sit and touch in basically every place the dog walks on. And many times after that, even without washing our hands, we eat something, like popcorn or chips. I mean, how different is that from grabbing something off the floor on the street and eat it?

What about when we pet them? Dogs sleep on the floor all the time. The floor is full of shit we bring from the outside. Many people don´t even wash their hands after that and go eat something right away. Isn´t that the same thing as rubbing your hands on a nasty floor?
I mean, i grew up like that. My dog was all dirty most of the time and he slept with me, i used to play with him and then go eat something without even washing my hands.

How different is this from sleeping on top of dog shit in the street or eating shit off the floor all the time?

Funny enough, i never got sick, besides a simple cold. I mean, we are supposed to be so careful about hygiene, but then we walk around nasty pets full of germs they bring from outside and nothing happens? Almost everyone i know has dogs and plays with them on their bed, couch, etc, and they never get sick with anything more than a cold once in a while.

Does does this mean i could also eat food off the floor everyday without getting sick? How would that be that different from waking up almost everyday with a dirty hair of my dog in my mouth?",microbiology,1410719150,ShinobiKrow,3,0,True,2014-09-14

In many of the lectures of my first year we were being shown lots of techniques with which to study microbes that didn't involve the use of microscopes and tend to focus on a more molecular level- e.g. PCR, and genome sequencing. 

This made sense to me that techniques seem to be (from what I've been taught) shifting away from microscopy- take for example in a lab in a hospital, using a biochemical test or probing for specific genes may be quicker for diagnosis than growing a culture, staining and searching under the microscope (assuming this is common procedure- perhaps growing a culture isn't required?). 

Or for doing blood counts, perhaps qPCR could be used (assuming this is applicable and not unrealistic)?

Even in other areas like environmental microbiology (I'm probably generalising), I remember a lecture in which our professor told us he'd been trying to get a very picky anaerobe to grow in lots of different conditions for a long time, and I always wondered if he'd be able to study the organism as deeply if not more without microscopy!

I'm sure I've overlooked or am simply ignorant to many areas where microscopy is better and much more cost efficient than newer techniques, and I was wondering if anyone in this sub had significant, better informed opinions than my novice views on this topic!

139,Question: Lab tissue culture contamination,"I'm new to this area of research and looking for a little insight from others.

Some of my cell cultures have been showing the same contaminant for a while now across several different tissue types.  At first we thought it was just debris or cell membrane parts but upon closer inspection the particles were not exhibiting what we believed to be Brownian movement.  They had what can best be described as an intelligent ""twitch"" or quick shrimp like movement.   We collected a sample and watched it grow.  It is slow growing; doubling over the course of 48 hours on average per each sample.   


We cultured it and the readout was as follows:

PROB | DIST | SPECIES
---------|----------|----------
0.834 | 2.376 | Weissella halotolerans
0.213 | 2.494 | Weissella viridescens
0.202 | 2.233 | Lactobacillus bifermentans
0.165 | 2.722 | Gardnerella vaginalis


I'm thinking the FBS may be the source as it is the only common denominator, but we are using strept/pen in the media and different mother batches of FBS over the course of this occurrence.  It doesn't appear to be inhibiting the growth of our cultures, but obviously we do not want it there.  
Anyone else seen this or know anything about it?

Thanks in advance.


EDIT: With regards to sterile technique and cleaning.  We are very sterile and the lab is secure and monitored.  We also clean everything: incubator, water bath, hood, etc. on a regular basis.  I can't think of anything we are missing as we follow all standard lab protocols.  That's why I find this so puzzling and was looking to see if anyone else had seen this or something similar.  We cultured the FBS but found nothing.  Something obviously isn't adding up because this same thing, whatever it is has shown up in three unrelated cell lines over the course of three months and it just shows up out of nowhere and the only thing in common is the FBS.  Has anyone had problems with stock FBS arriving already contaminated from the manufacturer? 

I'm not an expert on these particular microbes and how they behave.  Could one of those lay dormant in the media and become active once exposed to a tissue type?

First: TL;DR: I have two labs to choose from - both equally great in my mind, but a professor ""got"" me in to one and I ""stumbled"" into the other, and I don't know how rude / damaging it would be for me to turn down the one that the professor ""got"" me into.

I have a dilemma. I am looking for outside lab experience while I finish my undergraduate degree. I'm really interested in commensal bacteria in the human microbiome, and I'm *super* interested in viruses. Any kinds, all kinds - my first love is viruses. If I decide to pursue a PhD, I would really want it to be in virology / want my research to be directly working with viruses.

I approached one professor that I have a working relationship with and he asked a lab he knew about that is working with commensal fungi (*C. albicans*). Their research is going in a million directions in this lab, and I'm welcome to grab a direction and run with it, or just help out with other people's workload (""Hey, want me to run those PCR for you?), or anything in between. It's at a big-name school with great medical/research recognition, in a lab affiliated with their medical school. Transportation to and from this location would be a little tricky, but it would be manageable. They're doing awesome stuff over there and I'm welcome aboard if I want it. I seem to get along well with the post-doc that I'd be directly working with. She at one point asked me if I'm still looking around, and I said I kind of am because I feel foolish not to, and she agreed and said she harbors no hard feelings if I find a better fit. I believe her.

I have since stumbled upon a different lab that's working with phage interactions with a particular commensal bacteria - a real marriage of my two great loves. It's on the campus I go to school at and work at anyway (and my husband goes here too), and it looks like I could have similar levels of independence as the other place. The school is not as well recognized, but its profile seems to be rising a little bit locally. The convenience factor is huge. Plus I like it here and like the professor running it, and am already acquainted with several of the grad students I'd be working with and know from experience that I'd work well with them. Also, the research sounds equally exciting to me. I'd even maybe be involved in characterizing new phages! How cool would that be? 

I approached the first professor to ask about some other stuff, and mentioned that I'm also considering a different lab. I asked him if that's terrible, and he said the short answer is no. I should do what is best for me first and foremost, but since I'm asking what it costs him, it does cost him a smidge of credibility with the outside lab people. Immediately, I feel guilty. I had started to lean to the research here on campus, but now I don't know. I really feel grateful for the effort in finding this new lab, and it really would be excellent, but the guilt factor is weighing on me. 

My question is: how big of a deal is this? What do you think you would do?

225,Student Question about Staphylococcus,"Hey Microbiology!

I have a quick question about *Staphylococcus*. 

Background Context: 
In my microbiology lab, we have an unknown experiment where we take environmental samples and isolate bacteria and use one isolate to identify(or attempt to). I swabbed a Car steering wheel. I was able to isolate a Gram Positive Cocci, that form small clusters and pairs. It is facultatively anaerobic, and I have narrowed it down to *Staphylococcus*. However, when I performed various biochemical tests, my organism was **extremely slow growing at 37 C**. Isolated colonies on simple Nutrient Agar were small (1mm-1.5mm diameter), circular/round, with a smooth texture, slightly convex elevation, smooth margins and completely opaque. They were slightly milky-white and overall a very liquidy consistency. 

I have narrowed it down to specifically *S. capitis, S. hominis, and S. auricularis* from Bergey's. (Coagulase Negative x 2 trials)

Since my biochemical tests had to be reinoculated and incubated for a total of 7 days at 37C, even then, growth was extremely slow, and tests therefore were negative for a second time.

My question is: I know that I will not be able to accurately narrow it down to a specific species within the genus, however I am unable to find a ton of information of extremely slow growing staphylococcus. From what I can tell, a lot of the species have variable nutrient requirements (and since Bergey's manual I have access to is outdated, 1st edition), I am unsure of how to explain the slow growth. Are there any good resources for slow growing staphylococcus? I know that my organism is most likely part of the normal human skin flora, however I am just having trouble figuring out how to explain this. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. If this is not posted appropriately, I apologize, let me know. My assignment is due soon, and however I just honestly want to know more about this. Any guidance as to which direction is helpful. Thanks!

**Edit: Thanks for the responses! My instinct seems to correlate with your personal observations and the articles and information available. I am pretty sure it is *S. auricularis*, though I wanted to have more time to confirm this. I learned a lot! I need to trust my observations!

Here's my issue: I had no trouble getting the bacteria to grow in my control pellet, but I can't seem to grow the fungus. I know it takes longer than bacteria, but it's driving me nuts. We are not experienced mycologists, so there's been a lot of trial and error. First, we decided to streak diluted (1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000) pellet (previously frozen) suspension on Sabouraud Agar with no supplemental nutrients and a pH of 5.6 and high glucose (50 g/liter). Nothing grew after a week or so, we used Emmon's modification of Sabouraud Agar with Vogel's medium N salts solution (20ml per 1L). We observed growth within 48 hours. I picked some a couple of the isolated colonies yesterday and inoculated some Sabouraud w/ vogel broth. I checked today and there seems to be no growth at all.

* Gram positive
* Motile (I had to repeat the nutrient agar plate a few times because he thought it may have been user error, since I could not get individual colonies; then when it happened the 3rd time, my professor said it was just a fast-growing, motile bacteria)
* Catalase negative, he said it is a gut-living bacteria
* We used 4 different cleaning products (the bleach had expired, which he realized later, so the test may be incorrect) but none had a visible Zone of Inhibition and it actually **grew on vinegar** meaning it likes acid.
* It smelled AWFUL today. So gross. TMI but it smells like how my shoes smelled in elementary school/if I don't wash my clothes often enough...lol

248,The Ol' Career/Job Hunt Advice Post (CA),"I have read through the job hunting threads but particularly wanted to get some advice from people working in Canada, since our options are much more limited as far as I can tell.

To start, I have a BSc Honors Degree in Immunology and Infection, I went straight to McGill and graduated with my MSc. I have research experience in both cancer and virology. 

I love research. I absolutely love it. But I saw former lab members struggle trying to find lab positions post-grad school and decided a good route for me would be to get a Med Lab Tech diploma/degree. Trouble is, it is quite competitive. I have talked to the department at the University and they told me there is ""no reason"" I shouldn't be accepted. Should ease my fears, right?

Well, I have been job hunting in my field the past year, aggressively so for the past 6 months as I started to panic. And I have had no luck. I have been pooled for a position with the government (the posting went to an internal candidate with less education, go figure). I was offered a job state-side but they wanted a sure two-year contract out of me. I had a day to decide and was honestly torn apart because if I were to be granted one of those magical seats in the Med Lab Science program I would be leaving them pre-maturely and that seemed unfair to me. 

I am not sure if I should have taken the job because experience is more important than going back to school right now. It will obviously hurt my career being away from the bench this long. 

If there are any working in Canada right now, how did you get your job? I've searched job postings, looked on UniJobs, University career pages, I've started emailing PI's directly telling them to keep me in mind if a position pops up. We have limited pharma but I've tried there too.

Is there something I am missing? Or is it just truly competitive here? Would it be best to apply state-side, sink in two years down there and try again up here/apply to school?

Also, if antibiotic is given in a higher dosage, it's bacteriostatic. 

My qn is What is this antibiotic targeting? So far I've figured out it damages/arrests the PMF (necessary for flagella movement and iron uptake).

Since it's the middle of the holiday season I think trying to fit in a journal discussion might be tough but if we can decide on the format then have an easy start next month (I was thinking of starting on the 6th or 7th).

**Suggested format:**

Week 1: Submissions - Post your suggested article

Week 2: Tally votes and announce selected article

Week 3: Questions and supplementary material (a chance to post any problems you may have had with understanding the article and any additional material that you found helpful)

Week 4: Discussion

I wanted to give everyone plenty of time to go over the article but still have something going on each week to help keep us on track.

**Submission Guidelines:**

* Accessible - Articles should not be behind a paywall
 
* Articles should be from a reputable source
 
* One suggestion per month (just to keep the numbers manageable)
 
* Include a link to the article, a brief summary (just one sentence), and 2-3 discussion points.
 
 **Example:**
&gt; 
&gt; [Single gene insertion drives bioalcohol production by a thermophilic archaeon](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/49/17618.full)
&gt; 
&gt; The group engineered the model hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus to produce various alcohols from their corresponding organic acids by constructing a synthetic route termed the AOR/AdhA pathway.
&gt; 
&gt; * First example of significant alcohol production in an archaeon
&gt; * Multiple organic acids can be converted to alcohols
&gt; * Bioenergy potential

**Types of articles**

I'd like to start with general submissions initially but later maybe set up rotating themes like:

* Classical articles

* Recent articles

* Specific areas (e.g. Environmental or Medical)

That way everyone will get a chance to post their favorites.


**Should we have a discussion leader?**

No leader at all or whoever posted the article leads the discussion

Here is my issue (and I am hoping that anybody that can help shed some light on this topic will aid others in similar predicaments), I am applying to graduate schools with plant pathology programs, but my major does not match the program I am applying to. However, I have had experience in a plant pathology laboratory for approximately 1.5 years, and a summers worth of experience in a plant microbiology laboratory. Will graduate programs in plant pathology/plant microbiology think this is enough prior experience?

It makes little to no sense (unless there's an underlying variable I'm unaware of), but here it goes anyway.

We start out with 10mL of solution in borosilicate glass culture tubes that have been autoclaved. Antimicrobial agent is 3ug/mL and bacteria (P. aeruginosa) is ~5x10^5 CFU/mL. Efficacy of antimicrobial is determined by pulling a 150uL sample of solutions, sample is serially diluted and plated. Intervals are 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 9h, 12h, and 24h. CFU/mL for the sample is determined after incubating for 12-24h at 37C.

What I've noticed is that at the 1h and sometimes 2h intervals, there's no growth on the plates. This would be fine if that continued, but then it jumps back up to about 10^3-10^4 cfu/mL at the 3h interval, goes up, peaks at about 6h, then starts coming back down and goes to 0 CFU/mL at 12h and stays there.

* 4% Virkon solution
* Milton (Pure Milton, not diluted)
* Pine Disinfectant (Again, not diluted)

I have talked to some friends of friends that work in labs but their answer is ""I put in the absorbance and it spits out a number and I just follow the methods"" then i ask any references? why do you do that? do you know the equation? I get a shrug and ehh.. 

Does anyone else run into this? 

Also.. Yes, unfortunately I am the most knowledgable person in the field in the QC department and still learning, surrounded by Chemist and english/business majors, no offense. 
I hope to find help here and would greatly appreciate it. 
I have many questions but i'll ask a few for now since it really is bugging me.

Summary of DI water testing in my lab.
Method:

This is what is written as the SOP

To filter 100mL of water in a Gelman filter onto a .45micron membrane filter. then place membrane filter on a R2A agar.

Results to pick from is:

Results for no growth &lt;10cfu/g (I don't see how anyone could get that).
Some growth &lt;50cfu/g (moderate)
greater than a 100cfu/g (alert and sanitize system)

What I have been marking as my result is  &lt;1cfu per 100mL b/c no dilution. To me the results to pick from are bogus and I would need to rewrite them. I just need a reference so if they ask I can't say i just pulled out of thin air.

I have seen some C of A say &lt;1cfu/g.  which is correct?

Next is R2A agar enough to test DI water going into compound solutions?

I have many more but if someone could help me thanks. I will sleep better at night HA. ",microbiology,1422338410,[deleted],6,1,True,2015-01-27

I'm trying to make a Klebsiella growth curve, and I'm unsure of what serial dilutions to do at each sampling interval to be plated.

I know if I don't dilut enough, there won't be individual colonies, and the whole thing is useless, dilute too much, and nothing will grow.

* Was the paper written clearly and logically with the results informing the discussion?
* Much of this paper is by necessity descriptive, as the authors discuss how they characterised the gene.  Once they identified its role in C. jejuni biology was there a clear hypothesis for its role in C. jejuni pathogenesis?
* Have the authors shown sufficiently that it is pgp1‘s role in helical shape formation that is directly affecting C. jejuni‘s pathogenesis?
* Are there any other experiments you would like to have seen done?

449,Help with a sci fi book,"Hi, first I would like to apologize if i spell the technical words wrong or if I am not 100% clear on a few facts as I am not a scientist and am having to learn this via good old Google and a few text books. However, there are some minor details that I can't figure out.

I am in the process of writing a science fiction book. Part of the book is about a genetically engineered pathogen that wipes out most of the human race. 

The concept is that whilst creating a bio-weapon, scientists manage to create a pathogen so deadly and unstoppable that it destroys 70-90% of the human race. 

During their experimentation they empty the capsid from the H5N1 flu virus (but not completely, they leave the Heamogluttanin and neurominidase proteins on the outside and the polymerase 1 and 2 inside the capsid.) they insert something possibly a bacterium???? although not sure if that would work or even be necessary, it was a suggestion from a bio Engineer friend. However, she hasn't studied microbiology or viruses in a long time and isn't 100% sure. 

The virus needs to follow certain criteria for it to work in the book :

- Has a 2 week infectious incubation period.
- Can go dormant if under attack.
- Attacks the mitochondria and cause massive mitochondrial failure and body shut down 
- Have maybe a secondary illness that has been implanted within the capsid and combined with the remains of the H5N1 virus to create a super virus. 
- It can combine with any other pathogen if this is present in the host.

the vaccine can not be found until a scientist stumbles on a genetic abnormality with the immune. She discovers that this genetic abnormality is to do with the edothelium of the mitochondria, it is passed only from the mother and most prevalent in girls, however boys are also immune due to the same abnormality.

Once the pathogen has destroyed the endothelium a chemical or something (this is where i get a little hazy) is released that destroys the pathogen.

I need to figure out the pathogens involved and what mutation there could be to the endothelium. I have a fair understanding of the flu virus but I really like the idea of a double whammy and using the bacterial pathogen.

If it is not clear what i am asking please double check. As I have said I am not a scientist and have learned this off my own back so please put it in stupid people terms.

Many thanks.

I was wondering if anyone could share their experience or tips on primer design. I personally work with both ""regular"" PCR as well as RT-qPCR, and in my experience the post-docs who help me design primers just sort of ""know"" what to do based on their experience. 

I have tried to watch along and learn several times in order to be more independent, but it's a bit hard since they just go so fast and its hard to ask for more time from a busy person. 

For example, I have already read the NCBI article on primer design, re: GC content, etc, but things I would like to know are when designing a primer to amplify a promoter sequence for inserting into a CFP-vector, make sure you start the reverse primer upstream of the RBS and start codon in the original YFP-vector. 

I know its a bit of a silly question but I want to get a better handle on where to design the annealing sites, how far upstream/downstream they should be from the ends of the target sequence, how to adjust the length to achieve optimal Tm, how to check if you could create additional spurious transcripts, etc.

Here is a list of the antibiotic discs you see in quadrant 1-4:

1. Control
2. Erythromycin
3. Tetracycline
4. Penicillin 

The discs are also stamped with a letter of the antibiotic if you look closely.  

Here is what (I think) I understand about what's going on in this dish: 

-Soil is one of the best places on earth to find shit tons of different bacteria so theres a bunch of species in this plate.

-The antibiotics we chose kill bacteria in different ways but I'm not sure how, other than some destroy peptidoglycan, some mess up DNA (transcription?) and some mess up the plasma membrane.  

My questions:

1.  Why do the bacteria not care about the penicillin?  Do they all have something called beta-lactamase?  If so, how does this work?

2.  Why do the bacteria hate tetracycline so much?

3.  How did the zone of inhibition for erythromycin end up with colonies of bacteria inside it?  (almost like an overall reduction of bacteria vs the tetracycline zone of inhibition which is super clear)

4.  Why did a cheek swab spread over another agar plate in this same experiment produce an almost perfectly clear result (no bacteria)?  The mouth is supposed to have all kinds of bacteria, this doesn't make sense.  

Thanks for any help you can offer, even if its just one or two of the questions I have.  Sorry if this seems like a lot I just needed a place to dump this and get feedback from another human being, wikipedia is just giving me a headache at this point.

Our method is hoping to use the anti-biotics chlorotetracycline and chloramphenicol. In looking through the USP, it that one can make a solution of .5g of both antibiotics into 100 ml, and then add 2 mL per 100 mL of PDA solution.

However, on the FDA website, it mentions that in order to use both, chloramphenicol hydrochloride can be autoclaved while chlorotetracycline must be filter sterilized. 

I'm unsure which I'm supposed to use. My coworker says that he used to just mix the two and autoclave and it worked. But what if the chlorotetracycline was breaking down and he unknowingly only had active chloramphenicol HCl in there the whole time. 

Where would I find out how chemicals and such respond to different temperature and pressure conditions, such as the autoclave?

Thanks!

495,Soil and Compost Microbial Ecology: Struggling to find peer-reviewed reference material pertaining to biochemical testing,"Hi, 

I'm currently working on a lab report about the identification of a species of organism from a compost sample. I have found peer-reviewed articles and textbook material for most of the things I need for my introduction and discussion, but I am struggling to find good non-website information on biochemical testing. 

We were given a sheet in our lab manuals detailing what each test is for, but I would prefer to find some peer-reviewed literature regarding biochemical testing in general. 

Does anyone here know of any articles that discuss this (that are free)?

For reference, here are the tests I performed: 

Catalase Test
Motility test
Simmon's Citrate Agar test
The Methyl Red and Vogges-Proskauer Test
and I also inoculated two Hugh ad Leifson's media, one with glucose, and one with lactose. 

Preferably, I would like articles that kind of go into more general discussion of biochemical tests, but really any help would be greatly appreciated.

They are then sealed using the same sealing films as are used for crystal screens. Our inoculant quantity is calculated such that each well receives the same cell density and volume.

Our controls are not growing to the OD that we expect, if they grow at all and results are inconsistent between biological replicates. Some wells in the plate are still pink, while others are not, and there is no correlation between these and which wells are growing.

542,Microbial Education Using Soil Bacteria.,"Featured last year at the American Society for Microbiologists President's Forum were two programs:

Both of the programs teach students how research in a lab works. 

*The Small World Initiative*, which was created at Yale and piloted by 25 universities around the US and now has nearly 60 universities from the US and abroad participating in the program, attempts to find new antibiotics from soil bacteria. (This is the program I am most familiar with.) The purpose of this class is for non science majors to learn how research is done. However my institution adopted it for micro majors only, and made math much more important than in the class most schools teach (CFU/ml, c1*v1=c2*v2, ext as homework problems). Small world is backed By Yale, HHMI, Davis Educational Foundation, and the Hemsley Charitable Trust.

Yales Page on SWI: http://cst.yale.edu/swi
The SWI about page: http://smallworldinitiative.org/about#partners

*Sea-Phage* I know much less about this course, but It's a much more in depth than the SWI. If memory serves, back in June 2014 at the ASM meeting they had over 9000 (no dragon ball z joke intended) novel phages isolated, every student at every school every semester seems to get their own new and unique phage. I haven't kept up with their database. Seaphage lasts two semesters and spends one with students isolating a phage and the next "" Students analyze the genomes through bioinformatics(straight from their site).""

HHMI's page on Seaphage: https://www.hhmi.org/programs/science-education-alliance

The exciting thing for students in both programs, but especially Seaphage is that students isolate potentially novel organisms or phages. They then get to name what they find (which is exciting for anyone.)

Both programs require students to go out into the environment and get their own soil samples, go through the process of isolating something, identifying it and what comes next. Both take a student guided approach to learning, where students can design their own protocols to find what they want. The lab manual for the SWI is much more lax than seaphage from what I understand but both focus on students taking the lead.

As someone who was a former student for one of these programs, and now someone who helps teach one. I would love to try and convince people to take these classes if they are at a university or college that has the program and or add them to their college or university.

For my lab in Microbial Ecology, we are tasked with designing and executing an experiment as part of our grade. The problem is, I can't come up with a good enough idea to submit. Basically, we have 4 weeks to carry out an experiment related to this class and I want to get a jump on designing a protocol before spring break. 

Some of the restrictions we have are: 

* Time: As I said, we have 4 weeks to perform, report, and present findings for this experiement. Therefore, we need to keep things small scale and not focus on ideas that would require extended time to study. (anything involving molecular analysis is pretty much out).

* No cultivation of pathogens. Our Lab is BSL2, I believe, so they do not want us to cultivate potentially pathogenic microbes. If we do a study with them, they have to be heat killed.

* The study has to relate to the ecology of microbes. We can't just plate a whole bunch of microbes in favorable environments.

Other than that, we have most of the equipment in our higher end lab at our disposal. If you could help me come up with ideas to test, it would be greatly appreciated!

* Comparative analysis of Salmonella in fish intestines across Central Texas

* Comparative analysis of Salmonella found in deer and cow feces

* Composition analysis of biofilms throughout Central Texas river systems

615,First Evidence of Fungal Strains Isolated and Identified from Naphtha Storage Tanks and Transporting Pipelines in Venezuelan Oil Facilities,"Biocorrosion, as well as the biodeterioration of crude oil and its derivatives, is one of the major environmental, operational and economic problems in the Venezuelan oil industry. Fungal contaminants are able to produce large quantities of biomass and synthesize peroxides and organic acids, causing severe damage on metal surfaces and promoting the contamination and biodeterioration of fuels. No evidences regarding fungal strains have been reported to be associated to petroleum naphtha, widely used as a diluent of extra heavy crude oil (EHCO) in the exploitation processes of the Orinoco Oil Belt, the biggest proven reserve of EHCO worldwide. The aims of this paper were to isolate and identify fungal strains from the naphtha storage tank and the naphtha distribution network from an oil field operator in Venezuela. The results showed the isolation of four different fungal strains. The molecular identification by 28S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis allowed us to identify the presence of: 1) a new uncultured Ascomycota fungus species BM-103, with high identity to novel hyphomycetes Noosia banksiae and Sporidesmium tengii, in the naphtha storage tank; 2) two yeasts, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa BM-104 (Phylum Basidiomycota) and Wickerhamia sp. BM-105 (Phylum Ascomycota), in a highly damaged naphtha pipeline branch and; 3) Cladosporium cladosporioides BM-102 (Phylum Ascomycota) in a cluster oil well. DNA fingerprinting analysis using ERIC-PCR primers pairs also allowed us to detect the presence of R. mucilaginosa BM-104 right in the access of the studied naphtha system. Interestingly, R. mucilaginosa and C. cladosporioides were previously reported as predominant fungal contaminants of diesel and jet fuel and of kerosene and fuel storage systems, respectively. This paper represents the first evidence of fungal strains isolated and identified from the naphtha systems in the Venezuelan oil industry. The results obtained are discussed.If you have interest in this research, please read the [full text](http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=53999&amp;amp;utm_campaign=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=wt) and have a discussion with me.",microbiology,1426837308,Lisa3652,0,12,True,2015-03-20

**Microscopy/Phase Contrast:** Gram Positive Cocci

**Lots of antibiotic resistance tests.**

**Plate motility:** Negative (but only very minimal growth)

666,[College level Micro] Unknown microbe help?,"If anyone can point me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it. 


The goal is to name the unknown microbe from using the tests. There are only seven possible outcomes according to my professor.
Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus lutens, Micrococcus rosens, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescems, and Enterobacter aerogenes.


I strongly suspect that my unknown is Bacillus cereus based primary on two facts;

- Gram-positive reaction

- Rod shaped (Bacillus)


None of the other six posses those two traits together, according to the chart handout. The problem I am having is that it also suggests that it should be Starch Hydrolysis positive, and have spores (according to my professor it might have be present, unsure result).


After looking into it further, Bacillus cereus, is also motile, which was positive for me. Also while looking into it further I could not find a plate culture that was similar to mine (milky white, seems thick). 


Then there is the other possible route, if error is considered. Enterobacter aerogenes. Gram-negative, rod shaped (Bacillus), Methyl Red result unsure positive, Indole negative result. The images for plate are more similar to this, as well as microscopic examination of arrangement of cells (shorter chains).


Results of my tests


Macroscopic 

- Growth on Slant - Milky white pigmentation.


- Growth on Agar Plate - Milky white pigmentation. 


- Growth in Broth - Milky white pigmentation, settles on bottom in a ring formation.


Microscope

- Gram Stain Reaction - Violet in color, positive reaction.


- Shape of Cells - Bacillus


- Arrangement of Cells - Short chains, sparse *


- Presence of Spores - Yes.

- Starch hydrolysis - Negative


- Indole - Negative, no reaction

677,"A silly microbiology poem I wrote, called ""Dr. Stenwick and the White Whale""","    Stenwick stared with longing at
    The Cold and flickering screen,
    Wishing that the little dots
    With his own eyes he could see.

    His microscope watched the struggle in
    Those tiny alien worlds,
    But Stenwick would not rest until
    He saddled up a Sperm.

    He assembled himself a team,
    Of fresh-faced undergrads,
    And called up shrinking experts,
    From all across the land.

    They toiled day and night
    For little (to no) compensation
    (The board of directors had no grants
    For Stenwick’s sperm fixation)

    With tangled wires and reflective shields,
    And dismembered VCRs,
    The team assembled a shrinking device
    Out of Stenwick’s beat up car.

    After hours of calibration,
    The machine was set just right,
    Stenwick climbed in (atop a petri dish)
    And was gone in a strobe of light,

    The team quickly discovered,
    Projecting Stenwick up onto the screen,
    That though now successfully small,
    His plan had a flaw—
    They had built no un-shrinking machine.

Consider that you are working for a pharmaceutical company that has be contracted to find inhibitors of a newly characterized human G-protein. Your job is to develop a screening assay that can identify such molecules from a collection of tens of thousands of small molecules to which you have access. Your screen must be based on yeast growth, NOT a colorometric or fluorescent (ie GFP reporter). Using a schematic diagram if you wish, explain how you would engineer a yeast strain capable of detecting an inhibitor of this GPCR. Be sure to briefly describe how manipulations to the genome will be monitored ( ie what markers, NAT, KAN, HIS3 will you use). Assume your starting strain is BY4741 (MATa his3∆ leu2∆ met15∆ ura3∆). 

We learned about using mating and sporulation to combine genetic features (eg MATa X MATalpha), and synthetic genetic arrays and how to interpret synthetic lethal genes.

Hi! I apologize if this post is inappropriate for this subreddit.

I have an unknown microbe that I must identify. I am now on my final step but my TSI slant results (which I have done twice with the same result each time) does not match from the list of possible microbes.

It is a gram-negative bacterium. The results of my EMB agar plate showed that it was not E. coli (no green sheen.) The agar itself was very bright pink so I could not say with certainty if pink pigment was produced by the colonies or if they were colorless.

The results of my TSI slant were as follows:

Yellow slant, yellow butt. No gas production. No red pigmentation remaining. Very, *very* small amount of dark reddish brown precipitate.

My list of possible gram-negative microbes are:

E. coli, E. aerogenes, P. vulgaris, S. typhi, P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens, and S. flexneri.

I know it's not E. coli because of my EMB. I'm leaning towards P. vulgaris because my TSI was positive on lac, suc and because it was *maybe* positive on H2S production?

I'm really not sure because if it was positive on H2S, why would so little precipitate be produced? The first time I actually thought maybe just the vial had a little smudge of dirt. But I had the same exact results the second time with a different vial. It's been inoculating for over 48 hours at this point, shouldn't that be enough?

Conceptually I understand it, but while I have done a ton of subcloning, this would be my first time generating a genomic library. Anyone have any papers or reviews they recommend that cover the specific details (what cloning vectors work best (can I just use pUC18?), how big the fragments should be, is sonication/nebulization + end repair worth the extra effort?).

788,Extracting bacterial DNA from arthropod specimens preserved in alcohol?,"Note: These specimens are very rare, which is why I am trying to utilize the resources I have available to gain what additional information I can.

I know this is a long shot (with a lot of biases)... I have several arthropod specimens that have been preserved in 100% ethanol for 6 months to 5 years. The majority of the specimens have had the ethanol dumped out and refreshed over the years. So any DNA from lysed bacterial cells that had remained in the ethanol is likely gone. 

I have some circumstantial evidence that there is bacteria/biofilm residing within deep grooves of these arthropods (from specimens that had not been preserved in ethanol). My goal is to extract the microbial DNA and use iTag sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes to identify any microbes still present in the preserved specimens.
I'm trying to figure the best way to do so efficiently with introducing as few extra biases as possible.

Another thought was to let the specimens air dry or slowly decrease the ethanol concentration and then place them is some type of liquid media (I was think tryptic soy broth) to allow the microbes to grow and then precede from there with extractions. Although, I feel like this adds an additional bias, as not all organisms present with grow in these conditions. 

Any suggestions or insight would be greatly appreciated (i.e. is this completely futile?)

831,Maximum bacterial concentration - theory vs. practice,"(Holy crap, first reddit post, I'm scared)

Hi!  So I""m wondering about the theoretical and experimental maximum of bacterial concentration for bacteria, that is, the maximum amount of bacteria that can fit into a particular area.

I know this is rather vague given that bacteria vary in size, but generally speaking, how tightly packed can they get?  As an example, if you have a bacteria that is a cubic micrometer in size, you can fit 10^12  (perfect, cube-like stacking) bacteria on a square-meter of a surface (assuming no vertical stacking).  

I was doing some research on it, but I'm embarrassed to say I can't find the article of interest.  In any case, it showed bacterial concentrations orders of magnitude below what's theoretically possible.  Why is that?  In humans, aren't our cells densely packed?  Can this also be the case in bacterial colonies?  If so, what conditions are necessary to grow densely packed colonies?

Many thanks!

852,"Help: Staining techniques for various reptile internal parasites. Primarily Cryptosporidium / Isospora sp., Protozoa, and Nematoda.","First, please forgive me if this is the incorrect place to ask this question. 

I am trying to figure out what stains and supplies I need for comprehensive parasite testing of my reptile collection. I have my own microscope and regularly do my own fecal floats and smears, but would like to refine these methods for harder to detect parasites. I would like to be able to use staining techniques, and have done so in a university laboratory class before, but I don't know enough to identify what stains are needed for what organisms.

Primarily, I am interested in staining methods to detect *Cryptosporidium* and *Isospora sp.* I am not able or interested in Merifluor testing. Though I know it is the most accurate, I cannot afford it for the reasons I would need it. I was considering Ziehl–Neelsen staining, but to be frank I need to research more about the method to know what supplies I need for it. From what I can tell I need Carbol Fuchsin and Methylene Blue, but I also need a type of wash? I've also read some about direct fluorescent antibody [DFA] 'staining', but this is far out of my range of expertise. 

Now my second question. From what I can tell iodine can be used to flood samples containing Protozoa and Nematoda oocysts in order to make them more visible. However, the sources I could find on the subject (and likely there are far more and I am simply using the wrong search terms) do not give much information on the exact procedure. Apparently you can add too much iodine and make the sample unreadable, but what is the correct way to stain a fecal smear with iodine? Also, will Carbol Fuchsin work in the same way to stain Protozoa and Nematode oocysts, or will it *only* work on organisms with mycolic acid in their cell walls? What about Methylene Blue?

If I can get one stain that could be used for both purposes, that would be great. I am simply looking for the bare bones of what I need to run these tests and run them correctly. Any help is welcome, and I apologize for any errors in this post. I only have very limited experience with staining and these parasites, beyond treatment of them.

855,QPCR Mysteries (X-Post /r/molecularbiology),"Hey everyone,

I've been working on a QPCR project for months now. I feel like I've been getting closer to the end, but  I keep running into mysterious results, which I hope that people with more experience than me can elucidate. My supervisory committee has also given me a two week deadline to finish this work or this portion of my project will be scrapped.

The genes I'm working with are the ammonia monooxygenase alpha subunit (*amoA*) genes of beta-*proteobacteria* and archaea. I have DNA extracts obtained from soil samples. I have diluted all the DNA extracts to 2ng/uL based on nanodrop measurements.

QPCR seems to work on all my samples, which is great. The problem is that I can't create standards that work. I've been using PCR amplicons of randomly determined samples that are subsequently run through an agarose gel and then extracted using the QIAEXII Gel Extraction Kit. These samples are then diluted to a number of amplicon copies ranging from 10^7/uL to 10^2/uL.

Now on to the mysteries ([imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/kNWhv)):

Although I have managed to get ~90% efficiency and a 1.000 r2 (I've been at this a while), the melting curve of my standards is 2 degrees higher than the melting curve of my samples.

Furthermore, upon running the QPCR products on an agarose gel, the standards appear as a smear, while the samples appear as bright bands of the correct size.

What could cause this? It has been suggested to me that maybe running the PCR amplification caused a bias in amplification for a particular sequence of amoA that is different from the bias from the QPCR amplification. This seems possible as there are likely tens to hundreds of variations of the gene in my samples.

However, this still doesn't explain how I get a sharp melting curve peak, but nothing shows up on the agarose gel.

I tried amplifying from scratch using the QPCR master mix to make my standards and again, I get a smear (last image). The melting curve seems to have shifted towards the melting temperature of my samples though.

Any insight would be appreciated! If you have any questions please let me know. I may not have gone into enough detail.

Edit: I have contacted the supplier of the QPCR master mix that I am using (as well as the thermocycler) and they are also perplexed. They told me that they will be sharing it around the tech support team and see if they can think of any technical reasons behind the issue.

For the occupational microbiologists: I probably won't stay in the field. I enjoyed my degree, and will always be a science nerd, but it's not for me. Certainly not the research side anyway. But the degree opened my eyes in a profound way. You guys are f*cking awesome. You're doing the world a service in every way possible, and are the guys in the background keeping everything moving through tireless and often tedious research for which the doctors who often administer the product of your work usually take the credit. It's one thing reading a research paper, but hats off to those of you performing, writing and publishing that research. 

To the people just interested in microbiology: We need your support, and to spread the word that the field is really, really undervalued. Especially in the bacteriology sector. We've all read the stories about killer bacteria and running out of antibiotics because of resistance, and subtracting the media sensationalism the stories are to an extent true. There's some really exciting stuff coming through now (read about genome mining, biosynthetic pathway discovery and metagenomics) but unfortunately many investors and general citizens are shifting the focus towards virology. Both are important, and both need the attention they deserve. Keep supporting microbiological research, even if it's through casual means like raising awareness via social media. We're in a constant battle against pathogenic evolution and our microbiologists are the silent heroes!

So yeah, I don't really know what inspired me to write this, but without the degree I think it really would have gone unbeknownst to me how important microbiology is. So whether you're involved directly or not, forza microbio!",microbiology,1433717712,GodsRightBoot,5,51,True,2015-06-07

The smears background would turn out red while the cells would turn out blue.

If I remember correctly, when it comes to negative stains, the cell is not stained since the crystals of the negative stain are negatively charge (just like the surface of the cell). In order to stain the cell, a positively charged stain must be used(electromagnetic forces come into play; opposites attract).

951,"Help me make a ELI5 web comic about ""science""!","Hey, guys! So I've picked up the hobby of making science web comics (mostly for explaining test subjects), and I recently had the idea of explaining to people what science actually is. This is a really important topic seeing as practically everyone has internet nowadays and false/misleading information is pervasive. 

I guess some of my hopes with this comic is that 1) maybe people might find it easier to to distinguish between good and bad source of information, and 2) be a little less critical of the scientific community (i.e. by showing people what it is, they'd be more open to trust a journal than what Dr. Oz says). 

A rough outline of ideas I want to touch on:

* Science is not about proving an idea, it's about collecting enough data that says this is **probably** true. Science doesn't have a say on anything that can't be measured, like whether a divine being exists or whether that psychic actually predicted your future, and with that being said religion and science are not mutually exclusive; you can be a person of faith while being a scientist. 

* The way science essentially works is by starting with an idea and then collecting A LOT of information through tests and observations to either back it up or to disprove it. This brings me to my next topic: ""it's just a theory."" A theory not just an idea they had over some scrambled eggs at breakfast and decided to publicize it, but rather it's an idea that has held up to criticisms over, and over, and over, and over again in the scientific community. It's like building a castle and having it survive a barrage of attacks from your enemies over the span of decades and looking at it saying, ""Meh. It's just a wall."" It's not just a wall...

It happens that I did all my college degrees (B.sc, M.sc, etc) in biochemistry/molecular biology and he often expressed interest in these subjects.

Population genetics
- Pedegrees, Mendelian genetics
- Some of Kimera' stuff

Molecular genetics:
- Nucleic acids
- DNA damage, mutation, cancer
- DNA -&gt; RNA -&gt; Protein
- Epigenetics
- Antiobiotics, antiobiotic resistance

Bioinformatics:
- SNP's
- MSA's

Biotech:
- Protein engineering (i.e. chimeras)

So I thought I would try to post here a question about something I've been working on in the lab. 
I've been attempting to do an invasion assay of salmonella with caco-2 cells.

I've been using 24 well plates and I wait until the cells are about ~95% confluent in order to begin my experiment. 

I culture the salmonella for 8 hrs in LB Broth in anaeronbic conditions, make a 1:1000 dilution, and culture again for 16 more hours in anaerobic conditions. This usually yields me a CFU of ~10^8.

I incubate the salmonella and caco-2 cells for an hour to allow for infection and then 

Remove the media and wash with pbs 2x

I use gentamicin to kill of adherent salmonella, 90 minutes.

Then remove gentamicin, and wash 2x with pbs

And finally I use 1% triton in pbs to lyse the caco-2 cells, 20 minutes in 4 degrees celsius, on a rocker 

I take the cell lysate and make 1:1000 dilutions using sterile water and plate them on LB+Agar plates.

Then this has been happening for the past couple of weeks. I either get no growth on any of my plates, including my positive control plates, or I get two plates in the control showing growth out of the four, while 2 plates are completely bare. 


I think it might be a technique issue regarding pipetting, but I'm not too sure since i've been checking under the microscope to make sure there are still caco-2 cells lining the wells after each change of media and wash.

Hoping to get some feedback and advice on what I should be on the lookout for and any guesses as to what might be going wrong are welcome.

106,A question to the community.,"Hey guys! Hope I'm in the right place. Taking a chance here at falling on my face with a silly question.

I took my kitty Felix to the vet the other day. As I was with the Dr, showing me how to properly clean my kitties ears, he wanted to test for mites. I encouraged the idea, and he placed these, what looked like glass slides down, and started spreading this black gunk from my poor kitties ears onto them. He then pulled out this small bottle with clear fluid, and squeezed a few drops on, then placed another glass strip on top. He stepped out of the room, came back 5 minutes later and said ""Yep! he's got mites, want to see?"". My curiosity leaped as my I said ""Sure!"". I went back and he pointed at the device where the slide was. I don't know the name, but it was to magnify what was on the pane. I'm sure most of you are either laughing or cringing lol, sorry for my ignorance. Anyways, he showed me the knob on the left was to more the slide left and right, and the knob on the right was to increase or decrease magnification. The moment I looked I was grossed out, then immediately overcome with this sense of... fascination! These little mites looked like see thru ticks, swimming around in this fluid he used. I didn't know how long I was staring, and moving around the slide, but it was long enough for them to start talking and obviously hinting that I go back to the exam room, lol.

I thought about that moment for most of the car ride home.

I believe what that tool is used for is microbiology right? What kind of jobs or tasks do microbiologists do? I can only imaging is study, verify, analyze, record, the happenings in those slides. Or even run experiments with combining different... I dunno microbes(?) together?

I'm sorry for sounding immensely ignorant, but I'm just really intrigued in the technology, and the work that's involved. I was hoping someone would be able to give me some insight as to what one does daily in the lab. Or perhaps a path toward working in this field. It's pretty damn cool to see things your eyes aren't normally suppose to. Like... a whole world we can't even see. Kind of crazy and... odd when you think about it. All these little things we're sitting on, touching with our fingers daily. Hell I'm probably stomping on trillions right now as I type this out to you guys.

122,Sick for 3 months: Best medium for sputum culture? Any help is greatly appreciated.,"I've had a cough &amp; sinus infection with yellow &amp; green sinus mucus sometimes orange. 

After 2 months of neti-pot, mucinex, I decided to go to my PCP.  I always avoid antibiotics when I can; I believe if you don't have to take meds, don't use/abuse them, especially antibiotics (especially with the prevalence of MRSA, VRE, etc.)

Doc puts me on 3 weeks of Amoxicillin.  Fine.  SEEMS to help a little, but not much by the time I finished them. I work in an ER, and the physicians there seem to think I need longer rounds, 2 months or so. 

I'm no doctor, but I just don't think Amoxicillin is covering the spectrum of bacteria that's causing my infection.  

I'm wanting to just make my own sputum/swab culture and grow it myself. 

I don't know how hospital sputum cultures are exactly done, but I can't imagine it being crazier than the typical agar plates, taking a sample of my snot and streaking them across the plate.

My question is:

1) What medium should I use for a sputum culture?  I can make my own agar, but I'm sure certain ones grow respiratory phlegm better than others.

2) Is there a specific method for sputum cultures?  Swabbing for cultures? Maybe a website?  



tl;dr Sick, saving money by doing culture by myself, need advice on culture medium.

But again, with more info from you guys who actually work in this field, I won't be doing this.**

165,Challenge: Learn how to become a clinical microbiologist in 90 days. I'm on day 45. HELP!!!!!!,"So here's the deal.  I have a B.S. in Biology which I earned 8 years ago and took one microbiology class.  Loved it, and it was the strange desire to plate things onto agar which eventually drove me to go back to school for an A.S in Medical Laboratory Technology.  I'm in my last semester of the program where we finally get to learn, clinical microbiology!  Hooray!
At the beginning of the med tech program I started working for a hospital (a very nice hospital) as a phlebotomist.  Since I was working on the med tech program they gave me weekend shifts to work in micro doing set-ups (dream come true!).  I made a good reputation for myself there and a few months ago they decided to push ahead of schedule and promote me to a med tech.  So I've been happily working the second shift in Hematology, UA, Chemistry....

Here comes the panic.

Aware of my aspirations to work in the micro department, the lab director approaches me about two months ago and asks if I would like to accept a position working weekends, Friday-Sunday, 12 hours shifts....by myself.... and an older tech in micro (who will be stepping down to one or two days a week due to her health) has volunteered to train me.   I accept with alacrity!  This is exactly what I wanted and I never dreamed a full-time opportunity would become available in that department in the near future.  Here it is offered to me on a silver platter.   The caveat?  At that point I hadn't even STARTED class in micro.  My educational background in micro?  Laughable when you consider how much you need to know to perform this job adequately....
So I started training about 2 months ago, just two days a week at first.  My trainer (who makes me draw mental parallels to 'The Cruel Tutelage of Pai-Mei') had me try my hand at reading plates on the SECOND day.  (You've got to be joking, right?!)  But starting off reading urines and stools went 'ok', and now I've apparently graduated on to reading the CO2's. (Body fluids, wounds, respiratory cultures, etc).  To put this in perspective with my current education, we just finished learning about Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, now on to the gram-negative cocci!  @_@
For the past two weeks I've been training in there for about five days a week instead of two, but I'm starting to feel extremely overwhelmed.  I don't like to ask questions that make me look stupid, but when you're not sure about something and someone's health is on the line.... you have to ask.  I'm studying like I've never studied anything in my life before, but I feel like I'm starting to get that 'you should know this by now' attitude from the techs in there.  I've become comfortable, and dare I say possibly proficient at reading the urines, stools, and even the respiratory cultures, differentiating between what is normal flora and what is not, what is contamination and what is not.  I feel like I've come a LONG way since I started...  But I get overwhelmed when I come to the wound cultures and I have multiple organisms I'm trying to keep track of, trying to decide and notate what to try and isolate, what to work up, what to I need to do a gram stain of because I have no clue what it is.....  There is so MUCH I don't know and I feel like I'm fully staring it in the face right now.  The pharmacology tied into it and learning to navigate medi-tech to properly result things are monsters of their own.... My pure love and desire to learn this subject and work in this field has kept me going up to this point, but no one said this 'learn micro IMMEDIATELY' challenge wouldn't be hard and it's starting to wear me down.... 
I'm not giving up and I'm not asking for pity.  This is an amazing opportunity and I'm doing everything I can to rise to this challenge but I am starting to feel like I'm not going to be 'good' at this ..... for a while.  And they're asking me to be 'good' at this in about six weeks.

I might not be so stressed if it wasn't absolutely necessary for me to start performing in there, on my own, SOON.  Without going into a lot of detail about their staffing drama, basically there are three micro techs right now and two other people that 'fill in' sometimes, who know less than I do.  One of the full-time micro techs is the one that's going to part time for health reasons, and another is about to go on maternity leave (and then has confided to me that she and her husband plan to leave the country shortly thereafter..... and she has not informed the supervisor of these plans as they're not set in stone) and then lastly the supervisor herself, who is depressed and has confided to me that she felt like quitting she was so frustrated with the staffing situation after they laid-off the fourth full-time micro tech a few months ago.   Ahhhhh, my beautiful yellow-brick road of opportunity..... in the land of drama.

Does anyone have any resources, any 'I can relate to that!' stories?  Anything to calm my nerves a bit and help me relax and continue to focus?  Really, any kind of comment from real microbiologists would be helpful at this point.  I have discussed some of my concerns with my coworkers and the supervisor.... but I don't feel that I can fully elaborate without them losing confidence in me.",microbiology,1372378458,Solataire,7,9,True,2013-06-27

I was taking a class in electron microscopy and had finally gotten to the point of actually looking at our prepared specimens. Each group had taken different piece of mouse tissue to prepare for the TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope). Painstakingly we had made our glass knives and sliced the thin sections onto the copper mesh.

Finally we looked at the results of our hard work and saw the complex tubes of the liver which we had been working on. Then our professor got a funny look on his face and pointed to a particular section of the image. There was a funny looking cell with a tail. ""That's sperm!"", he announced. Yep, the tubes were filled with sperm. The professor then spent several minutes laughing and telling us how we had made an incredible discovery of sperm production in the liver. Apparently we had mixed up the samples with another group. 

Luckily, since the sample had been prepared correctly (just from the wrong starting material) we didn't have to start over.

233,Hepatitis Delta Help,"I am having some trouble understanding the mechanism of Hepatitis Delta infection of cells. I have created a figure to the best of my knowledge but the parts i am vague on are the receptors that the HB surface antigen attaches to and the actual replication of both virions. I found some literature but i am pretty sure it is wrong. 
If anyone could spare some time to critique my diagram and the legend it would be greatly appreciated.

Figure legend: (HBV pathway is in red)
1. Hepatitis delta (HDV) virus cannot successfully infect a hepatic cell unless the hepatitis B virus (HBV) has already infected the cell. 2. HDV uses the HBV envelope so both viruses attach to the same receptor, receptor used is unclear however evidence suggests that entry depends on the interaction with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains of cellular heparin sulphate proteoglycans, mediated by the large HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) binding. 3. Uncoating of both viruses after endocytosis is caused by the pH drop in the endosome/lysosome leading to the fusion between the membranes and release of the virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP). 4. Both RNP’s target to the cell’s nucleus. 5a. HBV genome is a rc DNA molecule that is first converted into a ccc DNA molecule using host polymerases. 5b. ccc DNA is then converting to a minichromosome that can integrate with the host chromosome. 5c. mRNA both positive and negative sense is transcribed from the minichromosome. 6a. mRNA + is transported to the cytoplasm where is translates small, medium and large HBV antigens. 6b. HBV medium and large antigens (HBmAg/HBlAg) remain in the endoplasmic reticulum for targeting with RNP’s to assemble new viral particles. 6c. Small HBV proteins or HBV surface antigens are transported through the golgi apparatus for secretion. 6d. HBsAg are secreted to the surface of the cell where they await targeting from mature RNP’s and assembly of the viral envelope. 6e. mRNA – is also transported to the cytoplasm where is associated with viral reverse transcriptase to produce the HBV rc DNA genome, however HDV proteins interfere with this process and inhibit HBV genome replication. 7a. HDV genome is a circular RNA molecule, the HDV RNP’s target to the cell’s nucleus where it folds into a rod like structure and possible confuses the host RNA polymerase I into thinking the RNA is a double stranded DNA molecule and allows the transcription of both strands. 7b. linear mRNA is transcribed (+ sense) that contains the open reading frames for HDV antigens. 7c. circular complementary antigenomic RNA is transcribed which forms the template for HDV genome replication, replication is completed using the rolling replication mechanism. Produces a linear RNA genome that has multiple genome copies, the linear molecule acts as a ribozyme and self cleaves with interactions with the antigenomic RNA before ligating the fragments together to produce the circular genomic RNA ready for packaging 8. mRNA is transported to the cytoplasm where the small HDV antigen (HDsAg) is translated, the large is not translated at this time due to a stop codon at position 196 in the mRNA. HDsAg is then transported back to the nucleus where it aids in HDV genome replication. 9. When HDsAg begins to come in excess, it edits the cellular enzyme adenosine deaminase-1 which changes the stop codon (UAG) in the mRNA to UGG which allows the translation of the large HDV antigen (HDlAg), once HDlAg is post-translationally modified it can bind to HDsAg which inhibits all viral genome replication and begins the assembly of HDV viral particles. 10. Once HDlAg binds to genome bound HDsAg it creates the RNP which is then exported to the ER and Golgi where the C-terminus of the HDLAg interacts with the HBV envelope proteins and allows budding off using the HBV envelope.

I've continued to drink little glasses of it without a thought or care, usually late at night when it was too dark to see anything. This afternoon I noticed it again except that now there is a LOT of said white ""floatiness"", enough that left undisturbed for a minute it all settles to the bottom of the pitcher to make a centimeter deep layer. I've never tasted any ""chunks"" in the last few days and the fact that the suspended material has multiplied while the amount of lemonade has dropped, I know it's not pulp at all now! :D 

So now the question comes, WHAT is it? I unfortunately no longer have access to a microlab to culture it and my phone's camera isn't doing well at getting a good picture (I can keep trying if you guys are really interested). I wouldn't think it's E. Coli, but maybe? The environment is obviously acid and borderline anaerobic too. thoughts?

Note: I am not worried about this from a medical perspective. My health has not changed and I think I'll be just fine. I'm just curious because curiosity...cats...it's a thing or something... 


~~~
UPDATE: first off, got a picture. as promised, it's crappy, but I put a line near the two layers to make it easier to see. This was also from last night. I left the pitcher out over night just to see what would happen. It could be my imagination, but I'd say there's more of it. I'm also noticing that a fair bit of it seems to form tiny but visible strands, almost like what you'd expect algae to look like.

Also, as you can see in the picture, it's an off white, yellowish color. So perhaps my earlier claim of it being ""white floatiness"" might have been misleading, as I definitely don't think it's sugar and still don't really think it's lemon pulp either.

My efficiencies of generating correct clones are about 90%, which is very good. However, all of my incorrect clones are of a specific type: they have integrated both the donor and acceptor vector backbones into a single plasmid. These are easy enough to screen against: I can just streak the colonies on both Carb and Kan plates, incorrect assemblies are resistant to both antibiotics. However, my workflow could be improved quite a bit if I could completely eliminate plasmids which include both plasmid backbones. 

To this end I have been thinking about two-component toxins, where I could express one component downstream of the antibiotic resistance on each plasmid and the the hybrid plasmid would therefore be lethal. One possibility would be using a heterodimeric restriction enzyme. However, each half of the restriction enzymes I've looked into are about 900bp, which adds more bulk to my backbone than I would like. For my purposes, one of the components should be very small, and the other component isn't size limited.

Another idea is something along the lines of a the PlyC lysin, which is a two subunit lysin, where the smaller subunit is only 220bp. However, this lysin doesn't kill E. coli.

My original plan was to go straight to grad school after getting my bachelor's degree, but since last year I have been so burned out on school I really want to take a year off to work and study for the GRE. I have talked to some of my professors about this and they all have said they actually recommend taking a year off and the professor I work for said she likes to take in grad students who have taken time after college to think about their choices.

My question is, what exactly could I do for my year off? A lot of the labs at my university have lab technicians and I would like to stay at my school and so something along those lines, but I'm also a little interested in clinical microbiology.

298,Odd question for you... Is it theoretically possible for a virus to alter a human's body in such a way that they gain super-human abilities like super strength or rapid healing?,"I know this is a strange hypothetical question and I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit for this but I'm hoping someone will be able to help me out.  Let me know if I should maybe post this at /r/askscience or someplace similar instead.  I have very basic knowledge of how viruses work, that there are many different variables at play, but I'm trying to figure out if this is perhaps scientifically plausible and narrow down what I'm researching.  

I have this idea for a novel or screenplay (not sure yet which it's going to be), that a virus spreads around the world in a pandemic, and wipes out large amounts of the population (I'm still trying to sort out how how wide-scale this is going to be).  However, the virus doesn't immediately pose a threat. At first it's having a positive effect on people, it's making them stronger and giving them these abilities such as super strength, super speed, and extreme intelligence (like a savant) but then ultimately the systems of the body, the organs, everything begins to fail because it's too much stress on the body and they end up die.  One of the characters has an interest in researching the virus to see if he can stabilize it and change it so that the effects it has on the body with the abilities stays permanent and doesn't kill the person.  He basically wants to create ""next generation"" humans.

What I'm getting at, or what the idea is about is basically the TV show [Heroes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0813715/reference) (if any of you are familiar with it) and if their abilities were caused by some sort of virus that altered the genetics of their body to give them those abilities.  I was thinking that the abilities for each character would be sort of reflective of their personality.  Two of the main characters are paramedics and partners and one is the ""emotional rock"" that keeps everyone calm during chaotic situations and he develops super strength with the ability to live and move things like vehicles, the other is a compassionate man who wants to make up for past mistakes and help people and develops the ability to heal others.  

Is there some kind of virus that could potentially maybe have an affect on their ""fight-or-flight"" response?  Something that kicks the adrenaline into high gear at will.  Something that could trigger the systems in the body that control, from what I've gathered so far, the sympathetic nervous system at will, instead of subconsciously, to produce the extra adrenaline that would give them that boost?  From what I've read so far, the body being in a heightened state like that for long periods of time is not good, and normally over-active adrenal glands or pituitary glands have a negative effect on the body instead of a positive one so I don't know if this is even scientifically possible.

Basically, I'm trying to create a way to give humans super powers in a scientifically grounded and realistic way.  I also find things like viruses and epidemics fascinating.  Movies like [Contagion](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/reference) or [Outbreak](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114069/reference) I find very interesting and scary at the same time, so I wanted to see if I could somehow incorporate that as the source of the abilities.  Normally in superhero stories it's genetic mutations or exposed to some sort of radioactive waste or something but I wanted to create a more realistic superhero story, one that could potentially be real.  I need help narrowing it down to something that could be plausible.

I've read a little bit about retroviruses and that seems like a possibility, that they get into the host's cells and implant their DNA, which then replicates in new cells (I think?).  Could something like this alter a human's genetics in such a way that it gives them special abilities?  If so, what part of the body would the virus alter?  I think the movie [The Bourne Legacy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194173/reference) did something like this.  They were using a virus as a delivery system to basically make the agents into highly skilled fighting machines, I think, it's been awhile since I watched it.

365,Question about Mutation Rate Calculation and the Luria-Delbruck Experiment,"I'm currently reading the Luria-Delbruck Experiment paper (1943) and was curious if another microbiologist might be able to help clarify some of the math for me.

The following is from their paper where m = number of mutations and P0 is the proporation of parallel cultures which had no phage-resistant mutants occur.

m = -ln P0 = -ln (29/87) = 1.10 mutations per culture

From this result they use the following equation to calculate mutation rate (a)

m = a(Nt - N0) where Nt is the total number of bacteria in the culture and N0 is the initial amount. Because N0 is significantly smaller than Nt it is effectively zero and they rearrange and solve for a.

a = m/Nt = (1.10 mutations/culture)/(2.4x10^8 bacteria/culture) = 0.47 x 10^-8 mutations/bacterium

They, however report this as, 0.47 x 10^-8 mutations/bacterium/time unit and convert it to 0.32 x 10^-8 mutations/bacterium/division cycle.

My questions are first where this time unit comes from and second how did they convert to division cycle?

I'm now doing a TSI test to narrow it down further, as each of them responds differently in TSI. I'm also lucky in that my other unknown, which is a gram positive sphere or ovoid, is catalase negative. That means that it can't be two of the six we're working with.

First time posting for me here, I'm taking undergrad microbio as a post-bac and it's an awesome class. We had a question come up in lab today that stumped me, and it's multiple choice, which makes me feel really dumb, but I figured I'd ask here, because...where is better?

""You are studying the formation of biofilms by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When you add 5ml of liquid media containing the bacteria at 10,000 cells per ml to a plastic dish, they stick to the bottom of the dish at 500cells/mm^2. After 12 hours in the dish, the cells began to form biofilms that have increased resistance to antibiotics and cannot be easily dislodged from the surface of the plastic dish. (Now comes the part that confuses me): You now perform the same experiment and see that you have 500 cells per mm^2 on the plastic surface of the dish, but you remove the original 5 mL of media and replace it with fresh media without any additional cells. You continue to replace media with fresh media every two hours. At 12 hours you have the same density of cells on the plastic dish as in the original experiment but the cells show no resistance to the antiobiotics and can easily be dislodged from the plastic surface. The best explanation for this finding is..""

a. Over time, the liquid media forms a sticky substance on the plastic dish and this does not happen when the media is changed every two hours.

b. All of the potentially antibiotic resistant cells are removed when the media is changed because they do not attach to the dish

c. The cells on the dish cannot communicate with one another because the quorum sensing molecules are removed when the media is changed every two hours

d. The biofilms form nicely but the extra nutrients provided in the fresh media allow the cells to grow so quickly that they do not have time to stick to the dish or produce antibiotic resistance factors

e. None of the above.

I'm leaning towards d but I'm really not sure because I don't know if giving the bacteria fresh supply of media would have any effect on antibiotic resistance?

I work part time at a restaurant and make hardly anything since I cannot find degree related work where I live in Florida. On top of that bad news, there isn't any reliable public transportation and I also tried doing volunteer lab work but the place I was at pretty much ignored my phone calls and emails and got rid of me that way. 

What I would like to do is space science research with NASA or some other organization looking for life on other planets. I really do not want to get a PhD but I will probably need a Masters if that is what I stick to doing. I need to pay my loans, have my own place to live, and a car though! What can I do with a microbiology undergrad degree to make money? Are there any certifications I can work towards that can get me a decent paying job out of college? Is military my best option? Can I survive with this degree alone? Please help me. ",microbiology,1385140564,enterthedragonite,22,8,True,2013-11-22

Potential grad student with interest in non-academic work (x/post with r/GradSchool)","Finished my Bsc six months ago. Have a couple years of undergrad research and currently working as a teacher in a tutoring center. Doing a LOT of thinking about my career plans from this point. 

I like microbiology. I like lab. I like teaching. I'm generally a lazy person and I have terrible impostor syndrome because of it but my adviser always had nice things to say about me and I just got an interview offer from my top program, which only takes 13 students a year (I need to pep talk myself often don't mind me) so I'll refrain from talking about my general anxieties about being qualified for grad school. I WANT to go to grad school. It looks fun. It sounds like what I did in my undergrad but less commuting, a stipend, more control over my hours and it's in my dream city. The only thing I hated about my undergrad research experience is that my project used $200k machinery that we couldn't afford to fix and it was busted for 2 years... also I was terrible at using it bc I am 5 feet tall and terrible at lifting. Anyway, as long as I don't have to touch the AFM again I feel very very excited about being in grad school and researching infectious disease critters and immune systems.

Blame it on my anxiety disorder, but I'm seriously scared of what life after grad school looks like... I don't really know what finding a non-academic jobs w/ micro PhD looks like? I've been researching but everything I see is vague: industry, government. I would feel fine making that 65k average... I would feel great being on the upper half of that distribution... but who are those people? Is there anyone willing to share what your career path is like if you are one of them? Researchers at the CDC? Scientists in a big pharmaceutical company? Consulting? Food inspection? I am very fortunate as my top program is in an institution that doesn't have undergrads so they're very upfront about not caring if their PhDs don't care about academia. I don't know if I particularly care for the ivory tower myself unless I find that dream project during the next 6 years and decide that I have to make it a for-life thing. But I keep hearing r/GradSchool proclaim that &lt;30k post-doc as a universal future for all PhD students. I mean, love your field or not, that is kind of... frightening. Yeah so, my question isn't really why aren't PhDs pulling the 6 figures, I don't need that answer. More specifically, why is this (http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes191022.htm) somewhat reassuring but then when I go anywhere where people talk about grad school it is full of gloom and despair? Is this a field-specific thing? If so, is microbiology one of those luckier fields? (Is aseptic technique really that marketable of a skill ha ha) 

FWIW, I have a back up plan for if I somehow manage to bomb all my interviews/apps. I might take 1.5 years to get a clinical microbio and lab science degree and get ASCP certified and then hide out in a hospital lab for a while. I LIKE STREAKING PLATES and I love light microscopes. I don't know if that's weird, but I seriously enjoy the manual labor of lab, so I'm not worried about disliking it. Maybe while I'm there I think about grad school more or maybe all the clinical experience will inspire putting a foot into a medical career. The pay for clinical lab scientist is 50k starting but caps off at 70k and then you're locked into that salary and that day to day for the rest of your life. I honestly don't know if I would get bored out of my mind w/ a job that's not goal oriented, but it's just that ASCP certification is way higher demand than a PhD, the pay is enough for me and the job availability is a lot more reassuring . But is it reassuring enough to pass up going to my top school with full funding?

Sorry if anything I say ruffles any feathers or steps on any toes... I am naive and under 25 please educate me!! (and don't scold me too much hopefully...) I just want to go to grad school and not feel like I'll always need a roommate to pay rent...

My thinking thus far has been to get as most research and connections under my belt as possible before even getting to graduate school.  My current aspirations have me working in a team with others mapping the spread of diseases and working in the field to investigate their spread as well as laboratory research centered on virology and bacteriology.


My questions for this sub are regarding what sort of qualifications you know of that organizations such as the NIH, CDC, and research hospitals and universities are looking for in potential employees? And also how would you recommend someone go about preparing for a career in an agency or organization such as the ones previously mentioned?  One final questions, what are the pros and cons of government employment versus industry employment versus employment in academia?

477,Visiting a lab; feeling ill-equipped to express proteins like I did at home. Advice and opinions wanted.,"Hey all. I am visiting a lab for a month to characterize a protein that I cloned. At my home lab I use 1 L Terrific Broth in a 6 L Erlenmeyer flask to express from E. coli BL21.DE3 pLysS and a pET vector.  Grow at 30C induce with 1 mM IPTG then move to RT overnight. 

At my temporary lab, I've only got 2.8 L Fernbach flasks. They aren't baffled. At my old lab, I saw other people fill up 2.8 L baffleds with 1 L of media and try to express their proteins. I never asked if it worked, but from some Googling I think this is a ""thing"" that can be done. I can replicate the media and temperature here.

My hosts haven't had too much success expressing and purifying proteins, they mostly do in vivo metabolic engineering and then look at the products excreted into the broth using chromatography (HPLC -&gt; GC/MS).
 
I'm concerned about oxygen concentration and misfolded proteins and inclusion bodies. I have a lab guru back home that I would normally refer to for advice but right now I feel lost. 

My plan is to make 500 mL and put it into the 2.8 L as well as 1 L to go into another 2.8 L. I know that there's always going to be some trial and error for best expression, but as I only have one month I wanted to see what other people here thought.

The issue we're having starts as soon as the NaOH is turned unsaid down, they expected a little would go into the tubing, but if left alone, the NaOH will completely migrate up the tubing, even though there's an outlet.  

Other students think they may have solved this problem by using a hypodermic needle as the outlet from the NaOH, but we were wondering why this would be happening, and if you guys had any ideas on how we could improve this.

* Observing live microfauna in a well slide
* Examining common pathogens, like a fungus sample from a sick aquarium fish, or detecting cocci in a slide prepared from my poor Dachshund's ears
* Observing objects without a slide, like the edge of a knife. (presumably, this means top illumination)
* Reverse-engineering the proportions of ingredients in things like dry spice mixes
* Polarized light illumination, eventually
* Dark field illumination, eventually

It is also important that I'm able to connect a camera to it; I have both a DSLR and a good quality pocket-sized camera, either of which I should be able to get step-down rings for. This probably means multiple eyetubes, so I can view and shoot simultaneously.

Many thanks in advance if anyone has advice on brands, must-have features, must-miss features, or even references to buy. I know the basics of operating a scope and preparing slides, but I don't know much at all about the different kinds of staining techniques I'd need for some bugs.

This is ideal but in the real world, there are too many factors that are out of the researchers control. On a related note of trying to do consistent experiments, I have noticed that the simplest thing of creating a homogeneous mixture eludes me. For example, when I'm trying to create a standard and I have to perform a serial dilution, no matter how much I mix/vortex each individual tube, I seem to get standards (which are linear) that are not accurate i.e. Ideally I would like to see 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, or something close but this is never the case.

I don't need citation of literature or evidence of anything, knowledge in the field is enough. I just want to know your thoughts about the antibiotics vs bacteria war. This is not for school or an assignment, I am just casually looking for discussion/possibly a debate.

I'm not sure if I'm just a skeptic but I personally think we will eventually lose the war against bacteria and that it is only a matter of when it happens. Here are some of my reasons why:

* A lot of bacteria undergo extremely selective environments (namely hospitals). The ones that do end up surviving through the selection are probably extremely hardy and resistant.
* Bacteria are capable of horizontal gene transfer. Several resistant strains of bacteria have already come about by this mechanism.
* Pharmaceutical companies will (and some already have) come to a standstill in terms of researching and developing new ""lines of defense"". After all it will likely cost billions of dollars to produce this new revolutionary antibiotic, only to be used against the worst/rarest infections? Or the flipside: this drug is going to cost a fortune. Will it not be accessible by the unfortunate?

**or** will we be able to fight back by informing the public about the dangers, dedicated research, vigilant screening/therapy? Perhaps I am misinformed about the pharmaceutical field?

I was really giving this a thought after I heard a story about a patient that had a UTI caused by an NDM producing GNB. They literally couldn't find anything to treat this patient. Will he/she have a UTI for life? Perhaps it can luckily become self limiting? Or what if it ascends into the renal system and even higher?

I haven't ever had a microscope. I've always been interested in wild life, I have an aquarium and an immediate use would be algae and microorganisms observation, but not limited to that.

I've searched some binocular models that could fit my budget and suitable for biological observation: Seben SBX-5, Bresser Researcher Bino and Omegon BinoView. I'm concerned about the quality of these brands. I've also read that the Seben's light can't be dimmed and that anything above 10x oculars isn't optimal.

I've also looked these microscopes, more expensive but with similar features: Windaus HPM 200 Led and Optika B-159. Theoretically, the Optika ones are decent quality and maybe more modular/expansible, while I can't find any info about the Windaus. I guess any microscope with DIN optics threads could be extensible in that regard, true? But what about the light source and condenser (dark field, phase contrast, differential...)?

I'd like to buy one that could last several years, I don't plan on upgrading it now but being able to would be a good extra since I may change my mind. I've read recommendation on expending more money on a good well-recognized brand but I prefer to go for something just decent enough now for an amateur and see what happens.

I don't plan to use it for photography, but I've seen people just point the camera to the ocular and take videos and photos that look good enough for casual use. I'm done with that.

I'll be buying in Europe (€ zone). Any advice to buy one that's good for me without expending too much? Thank you in advance.

Basically we are trying to get two mosquito cell lines to grow, C7-10 and C6/36. We have been growing them in the lab for awhile, so we know what we typically do always worked in the past. We had our cell dewar thaw out **and** the department allowed the -80 we had backups in thaw out all in the same summer. It was a bad summer. Thankfully we had a grad student at another school want to use some of our stock awhile back so he still had 1 vial left of each of our stocks. We got our BHK cells up, grew them, froze them back down. We got the two mosquito cell lines up, I did some experiments, grew them, froze them back down.

Typically we grow them in MEM, l-glut, 5% TPB, 10% FCS, and 0.5% gent at 27C 5% CO2. One trick we were told was to lower the FCS (fetal calf), tried new plastic plus only enough media without FCS to keep the cells wet so they were forced against the plastic, then back in the incubator with some media with FCS. Same thing, they are healthy cells, we see them growing, moving about, etc they just aren't sticking down to the flask.

I've separated the components of the pump into two different plasmids: one plasmid carrying resistance to ampicillin with the OM and periplasmic inserts and another plasmid carrying resistance to chloramphenical with the IM insert. 

When I transform the plasmids independently and plate them on the respective selection LB media (amp 50 ug/ml or clp10 ug/ml), they grow fine after transformation, and I streak them on new plates with the same selection, they grow great. 

When I transform my single transformants with another plasmid to get all the parts of the pump into a single cell, they grow fine on after transformation on an LB plate with amp 25 ug/ml and clp 1 ug/ml (single large colonies), but when I streak the double transformants onto fresh LB amp 25 clp 1 plates, they don't grow or grow sickly.

Did anyone else have similar problems and was able to troubleshoot a solution?  I've tried other types of media like M9 with similar selection, decreased the clp and that seemed to work on a previous strain, but I don't want to go much lower that clp 0.5 ug/ml.  (don't want to go to a concentration so low that E. coli's innate resistance gives a false positive selection) Also, I've tried different strains of E. coli, but my positive control seems to work better with this strain. I think I might have to use a different E. coli strain...

Everything's going well so far and training has been going well but we've been running into issues with media contamination as of late, which sets us back about two days. 

We use 500ml jars to store our media in within a waterback by VWR at 46 degrees. The jars aren't exactly perfectly sealed, and I wouldn't be surprised if water vapor from the bath or jars falling over once they have too little media in them would allow for contamination. How do you guys store your SMA to prevent contamination? Would you recommend some alternative method altogether for media storage? Any guidance would be awesome. Thanks!

Oh! Another question. We've been having an issue with our vacuum pump which we use for our membrane filtration system. Basically, the side arm on the flask is a little too close to the rubber stopper and fluid winds up getting in to the vacuum tube whihc causes corrosion within the pump, since we're testing coca cola products which are pretty acidic. Any suggestions on prevention for this? The manifold for the filter system isnt' directly connected to the pump, but rather the flask, and the back splash is causing the issue.

I'm a medical student in France. I'm currently pursuing a MD-PhD in a national program that promotes medical research.

I've been lurking around this sub for a bit but I've never had anything to ask/contribute until now.

I am working on a final project in which I'm attempting to identify a major unknown. We have been working with human pathogens/clinical microbes mostly but this unknown may also be an environmental, non-pathogenic microbe. 

We are using Bergey's to make a plan and deduce the identification of the microbe, and so far I have narrowed it down to Group 5. (It is a gram negative rod, facultatively anaerobic). I did a thioglycollate to test it's oxygen requirements and there was a fair amount of growth on the top of the tube, but there was a small amount of growth in the middle and bottom of the tube. 

So next I wanted to verify that I was working with a fermenter. So I inoculated an O/F leifson (Base tube, two glucose tubes, one with mineral oil overlay). The next day (about 16 hours later), I checked on the test and the ""closed"" tube was completely yellow. The base and ""open"" tube both showed growth, but no real color change.

So here's my question: we have been taught that a fermenter will use the glucose in the closed tube readily, turning the entire tube acidic (yellow) and use the glucose in the bottom of the open tube, turning the bottom of the open tube yellow. 

Basically, the closed tube was yellow and the open/base tubes looked identical. They both had growth, but there was no color change in the bottom of the closed tube.

728,Dispute with lecturer (and publicly embarrassed) over correct procedure - can anyone tell me who is right? (oil immersion),"Hi Folks, 

This is a bit of a weird one so I hope you don't mind me asking this. 

I'm currently studying applied sciences at College before (hopefully) returning to university after having my daughter. 

The course is made up of different units, with different lecturers. We had previously done a biology unit that required basic microscope skills, and I had asked my lecturer for that unit how to correctly use immersion oil with the oil immersion lens on the microscope. She showed me and explained that the OIL TOUCHES THE LENS filling the gap between the lens and the slide (but the slide does not touch the lens).  It was explained to me that this allows for a higher resolution. 

Fast forward to week two of microbiology, and we are gram staining bacteria. The method instructs to ""examine under oil immersion"". We have a stand in lecturer for our usual guy. 

I work my way through the lab, and when I get the point of ""examining under oil immersion"", do as my previous lecturer described using ONLY the 100x oil lens (after using the previous lenses to see if i could see anything but obviously without oil). 

I notice the girl next to me has put the oil on her bacteria and has put the cover slip on top of the oil. I told her i wasnt sure if that was right, and that the oil is meant to form a seal with the 100x times lens only. She asked the lecturer who then very publicly told me i was ""wrecking her microscope"". When I explained this was how my previous lecturer told me how to do it, she respinded with ""I doubt that! - under no circumstances would oil touch the lens"". I was by this point really embarassed, and everyone else was now putting the oil under the coverslips! 

I just want to know why I would be told this? Am I wrong in thinking the oil should touch the oil lens? When I put the oil under the cover slip I could no longer view the bacteria properly (previously I could!) using the 100x lens. 

I know the other girls in my class will ask our previous lecturer when we go back after easter break so I would like to get my facts straight before defending myself! 

TL;DR is the immersion oil meant to touch the lens when method says ""examine under oil immersion"".

735,Help understanding and quantifying HIV evolution,"I'm trying to understand how much trial and error is needed to uncover various evolutionary gains in retroviral evolution.  Starting with HIV as a model, I've already found some information to help me out:

1.  I've [seen that](http://ge.tt/9MP4iIT/v/0?c): ""the FDC-associated pool of HIV RNA would be about 10^11 copies in a 70-kg HIV infected individual.  [And](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/downloadPaper.php?id=242) ""[HIV] has a viral generation time of ~2.5 days and produces ~10^10 – 10^12 new virions each day""
2.  [Although](http://perspectivesinmedicine.org/content/3/1/a012526.full) ""the number of cells infected"" per day ""is unlikely to exceed 10^9"", suggesting that less than 100 viral particles can go on to infect a new cell.
3.  HIV mutates one nucleotide [per 1-3 generations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV#Genetic_variability).

From there I understand that HIV-1 M, N, and O appear to have entered human populations 3 separate times and there have been some interesting gains in function, but I quickly get lost in the literature.  [This paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2779047/) seems relevant, but the terminology is beyond me.

Second, they wrapped it in plastic of some sort. He usually mentions something about aerobic or anaerobic bacteria, but i'm not sure if this is him trying to fill in details.

This question came up on my midterm cell bio but we don't get to keep our exams so I don't remember what I did for it, though I know I got it wrong. Can anyone point me to how to begin working with this? 

How many copies of a protein need to be present in a cell in order for it to be visible as a band on a gel? Assume that you can load 100 μg of cell extract onto a gel and that you can detect 10 ng in a single band by silver staining. The concentration of protein in cells is about 200 mg/ml, and a typical mammalian cell has a volume of about 1000 μm3 and a typical bacterium a volume of about 1 μm3. Given these parameters, estimate the number of copies of a 120 kDa protein that would need to be present in a mammalian cell and a bacterium (you need to provide two answers here one for a mammalian cell one for a bacterium) in order to give a detectable band on a gel. 

I figured since protein makes up about 15-20% of a cell by weight, out of the 100ug that gets loaded, 15-20 ug should be protein. Then to figure out how much protein is in a cell will depend on volume (Euc vs. prok), but I'm not sure where to go from there.

The only microorganism I had trouble with is this one: http://imgur.com/a/HTsnL . I grew it on EMB agar HHT and this green shimmer appeared. From what I remember the classic case of E. coli because of the Lactose being fermented to very acidic pH.  But the smell and appearance did not resemble E. coli and when i sent it out for identification the 3rd party lab said it was Pseudomonas fluorescens. That sort of threw me off since Pseudomonas tends to be or is a non-fermenter.

I'm looking for help with any research articles or other valid resources that will be able to give me a breakdown of the different species of *Streptomyces* by geographical location and which species is most common in which area.

I have an interview in NZ on Tuesday next week for a lab tech job with a dairy manufacturing company. 

I've just finished my last semester of classes and now I have to wait for exams to roll around. I'll graduate (provided I pass, which I should - working my ass off!) with a Bachelor of Science (Food Science and Nutrition), with the course structure giving me a solid NPD base as well as a solid micro base. I prefer the lab work, as that, to me, is what a scientist does.
I ask:

•While I have the interview on that day, they also have a lab component to the assessment process. They have mentioned they will be looking at dilutions, concentrations, sorting and pouring. I'm fine with serial dilutions and concentrations (and I'm sure I will be fine with the rest), however i'd like some clarification on what you think they might mean by ""pouring"". Are they referring to preparing agar plates, or more performing pour plates?

•secondly, I've had no actual work during my bachelor's degree on sorting. I assume it is simply ensuring labelling is accurate and plates/dilutions are organised in some sort of order. Would this be accurate? I assumed each company/plant/lab would differ in their sorting process. Can you shed some light on this?

Any other pointers?

So the autoclave sterilization cycle was turned off by 35 min, but since  the door was sealed shut due to me forgetting to unlatch the door handle it was technically in there at 121C for 50 min despite the autoclave being turned off.

I will try to keep this as brief as possible. Let me know if you need any additional information.

I am trying to perform a plaque assay using HSV-1 and Vero cells (~passage 90ish) grown in 6-well plates. My vero cells are incubated at 37*C/5% CO2 in T-150 flasks with RPMI/10% FBS/1% penn-strep.

At the end of the assay and after staining I see no plaques. You could even confuse the dilutions from 10-4 - 10-7 as cell only controls (me being dramatic but the plate is basically entirely stained)

I have confirmed the virus is working by simultaneously running a 7 day viral suspension assay in 24 well plates. I have also performed this with two completely different strains of HSV-1.
Below is the procedure I follow:

1.Each well of a 6-well plate is seeded at 300,000-500,000 cells/well and allowed to grow for 24 hours.

Stuff happened and I am no longer able to finish my undergraduate courses in 3 years, but must do so in 4 years. This is because of ONE course that is unavailable to me for the next year.

OR. My other option is to get a BS in Microbiology (I am given the opportunity to double major in Microbiology and MLS because they are almost identical) and then apply for the MLS program. All credits check out, so I will be fine. I would essentially have 4 years of typical undergraduate courses, get my degree, and THEN start the MLS program (so I would have a degree before starting it, versus getting my degree after starting). 

I have no idea which is better. I have no idea who to ask, who to turn to, for advice. I have spoken with my counselor/advisor who is fantastic, and am in the process of speaking to professors. But I'm very lost. Does anyone have advice for me?

We haven't ruled out strep though because the doctors said that the test may have been corrupted, or too early. The girl was tested. Not me. This just leaves me with more questions.**


Back story.

**1.)** 3 months ago I made out with a girl^((1)^) and the very next day I got a really sore throat that lasted 2, maybe 3 weeks. I'm assuming strep throat, because it really sucked.

My sore throat went away after 2-3 weeks. 

**2.)** About 2 months after making out with the first girl I made out with another girl^((2)^) and she got strep throat. Her mom is a nurse, and she was very certain it was strep throat. For her, it was so bad she couldn't hardly even drink water. I got an extremely mild sore throat, only noticeable when I swallowed.

**3.)** 2 days ago I made out with another girl^((3)^) and now she has a sore throat. She's saying she has swollen lymph nodes. It's apparently so bad she can't talk. Again, I got an extremely mild sore throat, only noticeable when I swallow. 

In scenarios 2 and 3 I made out with these girls the night before and in the morning, right after waking up(never brushing my teeth before making out). Could the bacteria build up over night have something to do with it?

Am I a carrier of strep bacteria and just don't know it because I'm not showing any symptoms? Do you think that I may be carrying a virus that just doesn't affect me? Why do these women keep getting sore throats after making out with me? I brush my teeth, and often my tongue, once per day, in the morning, before I go to work. I brush once again in the afternoon if I'm going out that day. I never/rarely brush my teeth at night.

Could it be possible that I got something from girl #1, which I gave to girl #2 and girl #3 months later(via kissing)?",microbiology,1407288475,throwaway3771834,16,0,True,2014-08-05

Turns out there's a fair amount of peer-reviewed literature on the subject; gastroenterologists just don't like to believe it works.

These days, I work in a healthcare setting that involves contact with patients that have (among other critters) C-diff. Between Crohn's and C-diff, ""fecal transplants"" have been offered up as a solution, [with remarkable results.](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/12/fecal-transplants-work/) Apparently they're even working on a semi-standard solution for transplants- an ""off the shelf"" sort of thing to restore one's flora to normalcy. Being that it will be a commercial product, I'm betting it'll be expensive, at least at first.

This brings up the curious possibility of autologous donation. When I say I'm doing well, I mean- absolutely no symptoms for years, and all my blood values are normal. I've spent a great deal of time building up a robust and diverse flora: select probiotics, in conjunction with other (some fairly wacky) environmental sampling, and it's working.

In short, if I wanted to store living critters from my gut in liquid nitrogen, what sort of cryoprotectant (type and concentration) could be used to assure the best preservation of the flora from my gut?

Almost all the members, except the current president, either left or graduated. I heard it wasn't a very big club to begin with anyway. 

This year, there are many members who are willing and able to do things, but right now there's not a whole lot of direction. I joined the club because I was mostly curious about the subject and what people do about it. I feel like most members join it for the same reason.

Since the beginning of the fall semester up until now, we have had two lab coat sales as a fundraiser, volunteered at a science event, had a microbiologist as a guest speaker come in to talk to us, and had two general meetings. In the future, we're planning on volunteering for another science event and having another guest speaker come in before the end of the year. This may or may not sound like a lot, but I'd like to see us do *more*. I just don't know what. 

It might be because I've never really committed to a club before or that I know there are other clubs on campus that probably meet weekly so I think they're always doing things, but I feel antsy knowing we rarely have general meetings. On the other hand, when I think about what we would do in those general meetings, I don't know what we would do that's microbiology related. 

**Anyway, if you were part of this kind of club or are currently in a club similar to it, what sort of club activities would you want and/or expect to do?**

Also, as a completely off-topic question, does anyone know a good website building... website? I'd like to be able to make a more user friendly and informative one for our club. ",microbiology,1329009791,mbclubmembrthrowaway,5,6,True,2012-02-11
27,Future microbiologist searches for a college/university,"Hi, I am finishing my CÉGEP in Québec, Canada (it is the same thing as the last year of high school in Canada and US).
I am currently interested in microbiology, and I want to do my under and graduate studies on this part of science. 
I am looking for the best university for microbiology, where the reputation is good.
I was wondering what would be the best : either going to Université de Sherbrooke where I have many friends and where I will have the best marks (since it will be in French) or going to another universty/college in the rest of Canada or US, where maybe they have a better reputation for microbiology.
So, what do you guys think ? Does Sherbrroke has a good reputation ? My marks are around 97 % for science classes.

28,Which media to streak for isolation of unknown Gr+ cocci?,"I'm taking Micro right now (pre-PA) and have fallen in love with it. One thing I've been struggling with and can't find anywhere in the book or on the internet- if you were streaking for isolation of a Gr + cocci (genus/spp. unknown) on a Petri plate, which media would you use? I'm holding strong that TSA is the overall better choice (except for Streptococcus spp., which would be best in blood agar).
Thoughts? Opinions? Know where I could find some?

*Update: I found this:


&gt;The streptococci are usually isolated on Blood agar. Blood agar is one of the most commonly used media in a clinical lab. It consists of an enriched agar base (Tryptic Soy agar) to which 5% sheep red blood cells have been added. Blood agar is commonly used to isolate not only streptococci, but also staphylococci and many other pathogens. Besides providing enrichments for the growth of fastidious pathogens, Blood agar can be used to detect hemolytic properties.

I'm currently doing a microbiology practical where we have to identify bacteria based on their growth characteristics on macconkey agar. Every subsequent test we do costs us 10% of our mark, so i'd rather get it based on the growth characteristics alone. (if possible) Also, we just have to come up with just the genus and not the species name.

I streaked my plate last week. Checked them in lab today, it was a non-lactose fermenter, but had a light pink tinge in a corner of the plate with no bacteria on it. (The prof said to ignore this, but want to give you all the information possible) The colonies were the same colour as the macconkey and had an extremely strange texture to them. It had a smell, but not a bad one. Wasn't a strong smell at all. The colonies were extremely thick and had a gummy feeling to them. In fact, I had to try several times to get them on the loop. I tried to rub it back onto the plate, and it stuck to the loop. Took many tries before it actually came off.

I've narrowed it down to either Proteus, Serratia, or Shigella. Personally, I believe that it's Shigella. I could do a urease slant to rule out the others, but i'd like to (obviously) do as little tests as possible and still get it right. Another reason why I believe it to be Shigella is that the colonies had a fuzzy look to them, and there was not a definite edge to the colonies.

For instance, Clostridium spp., a Gram positive bacteria increases the numbers of T-Reg cells.  When T-Regs are induced by these bacteria they release interleukin-10 (IL-10), which prevents the inflammation of the GI tract.  An increase in the numbers of T-Reg cells protects the host against Inflammatory Bowel Syndrome (IBS).  A patient came to your office and demonstrated signs and symptoms of IBS.

* Shape of cell = Staphylococcus

* Gram stain = Positive

* Capsule Stain = Negative

* Appearance of colony on Tryptic Soy Agar = Off-white

* Appearance in Semi-solid Deep = Spread out from the center

* Appearance in Hanging Drop Slide = non-motile UMO

* Appearance in Nutrient Broth = Settled at bottom

* Growth on Gelatin = UMO did not consume protein

* Growth on Starch Agar = UMO did no consume starch

* Catalase Reaction = Bubbles formed, UMO has positive reaction

* Thioglycollate Tube =  Growth on top showing Aerobic property

* Growth in Phenyl Red Glucose Broth = acid produced no gas present showing UMO is Facultative Anaerobic

* Growth in Phenyl Red Lactose Broth = No change

121,Questions about a career in microbiology,"I have come to the point where I must make the decision about what I will put my mind to, study and then work with. And I've been thinking a lot about biomedicine/microbiology/medical research. To be more specific, get a B.Sc in Biomedicine, a master in a related area and perhaps proceed to a Ph.D. And hopefully afterwards be able to work in the industry with medical appliances or research.


But, I have quite many questions and regards about what you actually do after you are examined. First of all. Something I've thought about quite much. When you do the research, such as in any area of science. There is always a risk, that you spend thousands of hours, and years on a project that eventually turns out to be just rubbish. Nothing accomplished, no vaccine, no good data, the theory was wrong and so on. So, how often does this occur withing the field of microbiology/medicine/etc? How long is usually a project? How much of that time is in a lab, office, travelling, etc? Simply, what does one with in this area do? Can it involve creating something in a lab, going and actually test it on patients, get the result and refine it? Or do you just send the chemicals away and receive a paper a few weeks later? Or finding causes for a disease and then come up with treatment methods and testing them?


Also, how long education is usually required before you could actually start working. I know many continue to do an academic career. But for those who want to work in a pharmaceutical company i.e?


Is it easier for a MD to get a ""better"", or should you say. Less lab work job. Than a person who has studied something else. And do doctors who research tend to be higher in rank?


The research you do in medicine, is it possible to work on bigger scale than just cells and molecules? Or do you generally work on a snowed in small part of a disease/sickness?


Can you work with anything else than just lab-research? I actually don't know what it would be but, still good to know. Perhaps, giving speeches, diagnostics, epidemiology?


The money, can you make any money within this industry/profession or are you doomed to live a simple life?


I had more questions earlier, but forgot some of them. Will have to ask them later. Would be fantastic if I could get some answer and make my choice a bit easier of what to do with my life.",microbiology,1337633233,tjommee,14,11,True,2012-05-21

I have a metabolically active culture in stationary phase (the cells are limited for an essential nutrient, but have sufficient energy sources). The OD is not changing, but the cells are very metabolically active as measured by respirometry. I would like to learn if there is a subpopulation of cells which are dividing at the same rate that cells are dying, or whether all of the cells are metabolically active but not dividing. I was thinking maybe I could label the cells somehow and then see if the label is washed out of specific cells. I have seen some older assays where they inhibited the cells from forming division rings and looked for long tubes among a sea of small cells and concluded that a subpopulation was dividing, but I am looking for a less crude technique.

145,Career advice please?,"Hey everyone.  I know this is a small community (relatively) but I wanted to reach out to you guys for some possible career advice.  I'm kind of lost and I'm not sure how to proceed.  
  
I graduated college with a degree in Classics.  I never finished my Bachelor's in Microbiology (ran out of money, so I took the degree in the major that I finished on time and ran).  Possibly due to the hiring manager's ineptitude, I still got a Tech job at a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant.  
  
I did REALLY well there.  Within 2 years, I was an Analyst (about Master's degree-level).  I don't think a Senior level position was in my future at that company due to little room for upwards movement, so I left to broaden my experience.  At that time, I had tons of experience in LAL (endotoxin testing), Microbial Limits, Sterility, Identifications...lots of neat testing that not every pharma company or individual can claim to perform.  
  
Now I work in food.  This work is...unchallenging.  It's extremely dirty microbiology lab work - this industry is not regulated as highly as I'm used to, so for better or for worse my past experience has me looking like a rock star.  My manager loves me, and I could see a future at this company with a high-level position.  
  
However, I want something more challenging.  I want to be a lab Manager, or Quality Director, or something high up in management where I can apply my laboratory experience to the benefit of the company.  I believe that I have leadership skills and the personality that could do it, I just need the years of experience and knowledge to earn the position.  
  
So here is where I'm stuck...how long can I stay in simple/easy food before I'm pidgeonholed and sterile pharma won't want me back?  What are my chances of my years of experience covering up my lack of a bachelor's degree in a science at that high of a level?  Although I know some people that have held those high level positions with only bachelor's degrees, will a ""big pharma"" company even hire into those positions without a PhD?  Are there certifications I should be trying to get?  
  
So far I have a few options: I can stay at this current company and continue to perform boring food testing.  The work will not ever get challenging, but I do have a nice ""continuing education"" program I could take advantage of to go back to school for a Master's.  I figure I can make good money while earning the degree in about 3.5 years.  
  
I could stop working and get a Master's full time.  My wife wouldnt be too happy, but she'd be able to handle it.  Then I suffer a big change in lifestyle (I already have the house w/ the 2 car garage) for a Master's in about 2 years.  
  
I could go back to school (at a different college, so not much credit would transfer) and just try to finishe the bachelors.  I figure just going for a Master's will cover up the lack of a bachelor's more efficiently though.  
  
I could just try to be completely rutheless with job searching/hopping and try to find a supervisor position of some kind, no matter the industry.  
  
There are some online Master's programs I could persue (there is a Pharmaceutical Microbiology Master's program through the University of London) but I have no idea if people really even respect online degree programs or STEM degrees that required no labwork.  
  
ASM has a few accreditation programs I could participate in (NRCM in pharma/medical device I qualify for, the food science one I could qualify for in about 6 months) but I can always do these on top of any of the previously mentioned opportunities.  
  
Right now I make a pretty solid middle-class salary...$45k in Ohio.  My wife makes a bit more than that.  I have never really looked into Master's programs so I have no idea what kind of money I could make working part time while studying full time.  
  
I work in a big city so other career options are available (hospitals, pharma, food, cosmetics, etc.)  
  
Hopefully some of you have reached this kind of crossroads before and can help me out.  I'm just really desperate not to ""spin my gears"" and lose the forward momentum I've had up until now.

151,MBIO undergrad with questions...,"Hello all. I am starting my 5th and final year as a microbiology undergrad and have some questions about possible future career/school options, as college is definitely wearing on me and all of the people I’ve been able to speak to about microbiological careers have it sounding nothing like I expected it to be when I embarked on this venture 4 years ago.

I decided to go the MBIO route after I learned about drug resistance and superbugs. Seemed like really brilliant stuff. Unfortunately I ended up at a university that specializes in anaerobic and mostly ecological microbiology. No pathogenic strains are studied anywhere on this campus. Add to that all of the silly, seemingly-irrelevant courses I have to take every year, and I started to wonder (especially this last year) if I had gotten into the right field or not.

I want to eventually do drug research, perhaps. I want to study pathogenic strains. I don’t want to do this in an academic setting. At least I don’t think so. With how tired I’ve become of college, I was thinking it might be better for me to get a job right out of college and go back to school after I’ve had time to breathe, but it seems like only incredibly boring jobs await a BSc. Please, correct me if I’m wrong. 

Now, I don’t have the most stellar GPA. I think it is about a 3.3. But I have been working/researching in labs since freshman year. I was a student assistant freshman year in a research complex on campus for MBIO. Sophomore and junior year I was a lab tech that occasionally got to help with research in a lab in the MBIO building on my campus. The summer after my junior year I did a research internship with the College of Pharmacy doing some molecular work on a strain of streptococcus for my school’s Health Science Center campus. Instead of taking a “capstone” class for senior year for my major, I chose the thesis option and researched both fall and spring last year in a lab on my thesis project. This summer I am continuing that research under an REU grant and next year I will also do that research both semesters (likely for money as a lab tech, as I don’t need any more credit hours for this project). My PI really wants me to stay for at least an MS with him, but his lab doesn’t do the kind of research I’ve been craving. None of the labs at my school do.

I was really starting to hate microbiology until this summer. Full time research is where it’s at, I think. I am able to actually focus and think through my project and make progress; it was slow-goings during the school year. Anyway, I haven’t taken the GRE or even looked into any grad schools because I got so jaded about all of it for a while, but I think I’d like to go, and I’d really like to eventually end up in industry or, preferably, the government sector working on superbugs. 

My questions for you are: 
1.	How do I get there?
2.	Is getting there even possible?
3.	What steps should I take from here if it is?
4.	How hard would it be to get into grad school if I’ve made C’s in Molecular Bio, Biochemistry, and Organic Chemistry? (It is hard for me to be motivated for lecture-based classes. I learn when I experience things, and l my lab grades are much higher.)

I want to have hope that my job of working on superbugs is possible one day. But the microbiologists around here make me feel like there aren’t any jobs at all.

​In the novel Angela’s Ashes by Frank McCourt, a disease by the name of Mycobacteria Tuberculosis (MTB) is sweeping the nation of Ireland and depriving the McCourt family of a happy, normal family. There is more than one strain of the disease, and more than one type of infection. Millions of people fall ill to the “consumption” as the Irish call it, and millions die from it. There are many different ways to spread the infection, but can be cured; the cell structure of the bacterium is unique, but the stages the infection happens in are complicated and intricate.
​The cellular structure of Mycobacteria is very complex. The cell wall is composed of 60% lipids and is resistant to most antibiotics and cannot be killed by acidic or alkaline compounds. The cell is only permeable to such objects that it feels necessary are allowed. The make-up of the cell wall is broken down into three things: mycolic acids, cord factor, and Wax-D. “Mycolic acids are unique alpha-branched lipids found in the cell walls of mycobacterium and corynebacterium” (Todar). Due to recent research, mycolic acids are figured to be a main factor of the virulence of the disease. Cord factor is toxic, or poisonous, to cells in mammals such as humans (Todar). Because of the high concentration of lipids in the wall, the bacteria are resistant to many antibiotics. MTB is not a virus; hence they are living cells and may most likely die when an antibiotic is introduced into the body. In the case of introduction of an antibiotic, both Latent TB and the TB disease can be rid of. Latent TB is the pathogen of the disease, but remains dormant in one’s system if the immune system can contain it. People of healthy, strong immune systems are more likely to obtain Latent TB than the advancement to the disease. Latent TB may remain inert for many months, even years. If someone has a weakened immune system due to another disease such as HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, they are more susceptible to the actual disease rather than just the Latent version. If a victim of HIV is infected with MTB, they will need extensive medication. Not only will having a deficiency in one’s immune system cause problems, but there are also two different strains of MTB. They, also, will require specialized treatments to control and cure the victim. They are known as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). While rare, it can still just as easily spread from one person to another.
​Mycobacteria Tuberculosis is airborne, meaning that it is so miniscule, it spreads travels through the air from people coughing, sneezing, speaking or singing. MTB is generally documented in places of fairly large, concentrated communities. Victims that serve as reservoirs for the bacteria’s reproduction sites are the only people that can spread the disease. Latent TB is not contagious unless is advances to the actual disease stage. People that are most likely to develop the disease are ones of third world countries, jails, alcoholism, immune system deficiencies, or are homeless. Another way to acquire said disease is by drinking unpasteurized milk containing mycobacteria bovis. Mycobacteria bovis is mainly found in cows, but can be transferred to humans. If a human receives the bacteria, they will develop either Latent TB or the TB disease. No symptoms are experienced when one has Latent TB, but can be recognized on a chest x-ray and will test positive for the tuberculin skin test. There are many symptoms of the disease and should be checked out by a registered doctor if experienced. Some symptoms include, but are not limited to chest pains, fatigue, chills, fever, night sweats, and coughing up of blood. If infected with the disease, the hostage of the fatal bacteria may not get sick right away. If a bad cough persists for more than three weeks, the case should be investigated by a doctor.
​The three most reliable ways to determine if someone has MTB is the Mantoux skin test, chest x-rays, and TB QuantiFERON Gold. When someone receives the skin test, “a small amount of liquid material is injected just under the top layer of the skin on the patient’s arm” (Understanding Tuberculosis- Diagnosis and Treatment). If the tested patient develops a large red welt at or around the injection site, they are infected. They do not necessarily have the disease, but the size of the welt depends on the risk factors for developing the disease. Another way to diagnose MTB is the TB QuantiFERON Gold, which is a blood test. If the outcome is positive, then the tested is infected. Whether the tested patient has the active form of the disease or not should be determined by a chest x-ray. If the patients’ tests come back positive, their physicians will prescribe medications. For Latent TB, the health specialist will most likely prescribe isoniazid (INH) to prevent the infection from advancing. The patient will be prescribed a daily dose, and should refrain from skipping doses. Elders over the age of 60 are prone to more side effects than an average adult, so they will also be given vitamin B6, pyridoxine. If someone has the viral MTB disease, the person’s doctor will prescribe one of four first-line anti-TB agents such as isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), ethembutol (EMB), or pyrazinamide (PZA). In order to completely rid someone’s system of MTB, they must continually take the drug for six to nine months, depending on the severity. After the initial phase of drug consumption of two months, the patient has the option whether or not they desire to continue treatment. If they decide to discontinue the treatment, there is a chance that the disease will relapse and the person will need to start it over again. A patient with MDR-TB has a strain of MTB that has evolved to be resistant to the two most powerful first-line drugs, INH and RIF. MDR-TB is treatable but requires about two years of chemotherapy and second-line drugs that may have severe, yet manageable reactions. XDR-TB poses a serious threat if said patient has HIV. Though MDR- and XDR-TB are relatively rare, Latent TB and the TB disease are more common, but advancements in the medical field have slowed the rate of the spread of the bacteria, bacilli. In conclusion, if the correct and recommended treatments are not completed, the disease will progress stages and is fatal.
​Mycobacteria Tuberculosis normally occurs in five stages. In the first stages, the unexpecting victim inhales what is called droplet nuclei. Once in the human’s body, the droplets are “taken up by alveolar macrophages” (Todar). The macrophages, however, are unresponsive and cannot kill the bacteria. Once at the alveoli, the disease, whether the active form, or Latent, begins. The second stage begins about seven to twenty-one after the nuclei settle in the respiratory tract. At this point, the mycobacteria are virtually indestructible to the inactivated macrophages and reproduce at a rapid rate. Stage three, the bacteria have taken refuge in the body and the victim is tuberculin-positive. Also in this stage, tubercles begin to form, but because of such a low pH, cannot reproduce. If, in stage four, the tubercles permeate a bronchus, the infection will spread to other parts of the lungs. Secondary lesions also form in stage four, and are visible on an x-ray of the chest of the infected. Due to unknown reasons, the caseous centers of the tubercle liquefy and the MTB cells begin to quickly reproduce in the fifth stage. This buildup of cells causes the walls of the bronchi to burst, and the load begins to spread throughout the lung even more (Todar). Most of the time, at some point during the infestation of the mycobacteria, the victim begins to control the bacteria and the lesions begin to heal. This is referred to as the Ghon complex.
​Throughout the many stages of the infection, mycobacteria tuberculosis can be controlled and/or cured at any time. The diminutive size of the bacteria causes the infection to spread by being airborne. Due to advancements in the medical field, MTB has slowed to a minimal amount of people being infected. Though cures have been found and tested, millions are still dying of the disease mycobacteria tuberculosis.

157,Microbiology Question. ,"Hello Microbiology community! I'm going to start my second year of college in about 2 months and just had some questions about Microbiology. I am really interested in food and the different ways it reacts with its surroundings, such as heat and fermentation. I'm going to be taking an intro course in Chemistry, as that is required at my school before pursuing other sciences such as microbiology. 

My question is, if I wanted to study the micro organisms that react with and change food would it be best to study microbiology or would I want to combine it with another science of some sort, and what would that area of study be called? Thank you!  ",microbiology,1341855221,Thunder_Cats,13,5,True,2012-07-09
158,Undergraduate thesis focusing on the predatory activity of a cave bacterium *Ensifer adhaerens*.,"I started dabbling in the reddit world around 2 months ago and I really like some of the replies and input that fellow redditors deliver in the sub-reddit community. Therefore, I thought I'd try my luck and see if there is anyone interested in my undergrad thesis topic.

First of all, I'm working with a non-obligate cave predator called *E. adhaerens* which was isloated from 2 different caves, one being in New Mexico and the other located in Kentucky. Upon receiving my PCR results, I was glad to see that they are both 98% similar to the sequences in the Genbank. 

I was given this project as an ongoing topic from several others over the past few years including my professor and a professor from Kentucky who I believe is now in Ohio. The focus of my particular project will be on the effect of varying pH levels on the predatory activity. It has already been found that *E. adhaerens* doesn't predate under conditions of stress, meaning that it seemingly only predates when it doesn't need to because nutrient levels are high. It has also been found that when nutrient levels are low, the bacteria becomes a part of a biofilm to help preserve itself and the community around it. 

The first step in the lab aspect of my thesis will be to determine a reliable and measurable method of observing predation. After several weeks of searching, I have narrowed the list down to two methods, the streak plate method and the bacterial lawn method. The streak plate method basically consists of a line of prey and a droplet of predator, while the lawn method consists of a lawn of prey with a drop of predator in the middle. Both have specifics on size and quantity, and most importantly, the standardization of samples using spectrophotometry before the assays are ran. They will be observed over a period of time at intervals, and the measurements will be collected for data analysis in the form of a graph. 

At this point, the same procedures will be replicated for an array of pH levels to observe minimum and maximum conditions for predation. These are the real results of the study. I believe that the results of my study will be combined with other results for a more enveloping look into environmental effects on the initiation of predation. 

If I can get reliable results from this, I would really like to observe some predation using SEM and TEM. Then, I would love to be a part of the overall process of piecing together the model of predation, notice I didn't say mode or mechanism of predation because that is not the aim. However, that is more where my interest is because I think it would be much more useful to know how this is happening rather than simply figuring out what factors govern the act. I also understand that this is a one step at a time type of project so it will be useful to figure out how to make it happen before figuring out the mechanism. 

I guess I am putting this in here because I love science and especially microbiology and reddit provides an awesome place to share your interest with others but I would also appreciate any feedback, questions, comments, concerns, or even criticisms that you all my offer. I think one of the best ways to know your topic is to have others give their view on it as well. Thanks in advance to everyone who replies!",microbiology,1341887488,Frazierjm,10,12,True,2012-07-09

163,A question about sustainable colonies in gut flora,"I've grown to hate the term ""probiotic"" but I have recently been tinkering with my gut microbiome with various fermented foods, cultured foods and bacterial supplements. I've noticed that almost all dietary changes designed to augment one's gut flora required continuous consumption in order to keep bacterial populations up. This leads me to believe that beneficial bacteria (like Lactobacillus and friends) can't survive on their own in the human digestive tract. 

I've gathered from some research on beer-brewing and pickling that many bacteria will eventually produce so much acid that they kill themselves but then how do they survive stomach acide?

While I don't plan to stop eating tasty kimchi or drinking kefir, I would like to learn why their bacterial populations can't form sustainable colonies. I'd also like to know what strains *can* form self-sustaining colonies and where they come from.

171,I think some of you might find interesting that my wife might have Intestinal Spirochetosis.,"She had a colonoscopy and an endoscopy done a couple weeks back.  She had been complaining of diarrhea and abdominal cramping for a long time now and IBS medications haven't relieved the symptoms.  The results of the colonoscopy showed spirochetes and now she has to give a stool sample for confirmation.  Her Dr. said that this disease is mostly found in third world countries in homosexual men with AIDS as it is contracted by fecal-oral contamination and almost never found in women.   While in her Dr.'s office, he made a phone call to the CDC(he has no idea how to treat it) where they said she might have to go across country to their research hospital in(I think) Washington DC.  If that's the case, my wife will have the first confirmed case of IS in a female in the USA in over 20 years according to what her Dr. said.  I haven't found anything about treatment of IS in women.  I'm assuming they will eventually prescribe metronidazole.  From what I've read, it's the only treatment and it works about 50% of the time. Here is an article I found on IS  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2830567/

172,Contamination Problem....Suggestions Please!,"I am literally about to go insane in the lab. I'm working on an undergrad thesis and I can't even get the project off the ground because my original sample of bacteria (Ensifer adhaerens) will not purify. I know most of the pros around here are thinking that I'm contaminating it or doing something wrong but this isn't my first rodeo. 

I purify samples all the time in the lab because I'm a teacher's assistant for the microbiology class at my college and that's a big part of having things ready. However, no matter how many streak plates or serial dilution spread plates I do, I cannot get this damn sample clean. To be honest, I'm really getting bummed out about it because this thesis is really important to me and I can't even get it off the ground. 

For those who want to know the details, the streak plates are all the same in that they always look fairly clean but in a couple days differences in morphology are always apparent. The spread plate results showed three different colony morphologies. I streak plated those three and picked an isolated colony from each and transferred that to individual broths. The Gram stain still shows contamination in all three with Gram positive, either streptococci or staphylococci present (the microscopes here aren't the best so it's hard to tell).

I didn't notice much of a difference till the next day. I was in an epic mood, energetic, focused, and perfectly happy to be sober (I'm struggling with kicking a decade of trees). By the fourth day, the feeling had faded and I was left feeling like my old self. No crash, no drop. I could tell when I started craving trees again.

I don't know of many that know of this supplement, there's a couple of co-ops here in Portland that sell it, but otherwise it's completely hit-or-miss. Either people don't have a clue what I'm talking about or they'll start foaming at the mouth about how incredible this stuff is.

I'm most interested in Astrobiology, more or less the ability of microorganisms to live and thrive in extreme environments (such as Mars or Titan). 

I have a DECENT GPA (3.4), part of a couple honor societies, participate in community service, volunteer for the school. You know the happy, fluffy things. 

My only concern is that my undergrad degree will be in Psychology while I will have minors in biology and chemistry. I originally was going to try to go to med school, but it seemed like immediately after I began delving into the world of Microbiology, I was hooked. And after discovering I could combine my infatuation with space with my new love for these little silly microbes I instantly began looking at prospective schools. 

Since I was a psych student, my research experience is limited to Neuroscience. I worked as a research assistant on a study concerning the amount of activity seen in rat multipolar neurons in the superior colliculus. 

My concern is that this research experience is not very transferable nor really all that applicable to microbiology. I have most of the classes normal bio majors have under their belts (organic 1&amp;2, microbio, biochem, microbial diversity, intro classes), but I haven't taken molecular or cell. I have many, many molecular bio/cell bio books on pdf so I read those to keep up. I also try my best to learn about techniques utilized frequently in molecular labs (blot, pcr, extraction, etc), but I'm worried my lack of hands-on experience in a molecular or cell bio lab will hurt my application(s). 

I'm planning to get recommendations from my research lab advisor, my Microbiology professor (she knows me pretty well, has had me in two classes, knows my drive), and I'm stuck trying to decide between my microbiology lab instructor (she knows how i'd work in a micro lab) or either my Organic chem prof or my biochem prof. Both of them were my lab instructors as well.

237,Plasmid prep isn't working. I hate my life. (x-posted from /r/labrats in hopes of getting more ideas),"[Original thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/10kljs/plasmid_prep_isnt_working_i_hate_my_life/)


I’ve been struggling for months with poor plasmid yield from Maxipreps. No one in my lab seems to care, even though we can’t do anything without plasmid. And no one has time to help me troubleshoot, or try and do a prep themselves. But I’m getting blamed for not being able to do something that even an undergrad should be able to do. It’s extremely frustrating, and I’m pretty much out of ideas for things to try. If anyone has some insight, please, speak up. There’s a TL;DR at the bottom, but if you’re going to suggest something, please read everything, because I’ve probably already tried it.

**My protocols:**

**Transformation:**

• Thaw 50uL aliquot of DH5α on ice

• Add plasmid (250 pg to 10 ng have been tried)

• Incubate on ice 30 min

• Heat shock at 42C for 20 sec

• Incubate on ice 3 min

• Add 950 uL SOC

• Incubate 60 min at 37C on rotator

• Plate (10-100uL depending upon amount of DNA added) onto LB + Amp (100 ug/mL)

o (Ampicillin is always freshly spread onto plate)

• Incubate ON at 37C

**Plasmid culture:**

• Re-plate transformation plate and incubate ON at 37C

o I have been told that freshly transformed cells perform better if allowed to grow for a little while. I tested colonies from a transformation plate vs. a new plate with Minipreps, but saw no difference in recovery.

• Pick single colony and inoculate 2 mL LB + Amp culture

• Incubate 5-8 hr at 37C, 200 rpm

• Inoculate 150 mL LB + Amp culture with 150 uL (1:1000 diln) starter culture

• Grow 12-16 hr at 37C, 200 rpm

• Measure A600 of culture

• Collect cells by centrifugation (15 min at 5000 g)

**Plasmid prep:**

• Determined pellet wet weight

• Pelleted cells are always used immediately

• As per Qiagen kit instructions

o Maxiprep kit used: QIAfilter Plasmid Maxi Kit

o http://www.qiagen.com/products/plasmid/qiagenplasmidpurificationsystem/qiafilterplasmidmaxikit.aspx#Tabs=t1

o Miniprep kit used: QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit

o http://www.qiagen.com/products/plasmid/qiaprepminiprepsystem/qiaprepspinminiprepkit.aspx#Tabs=t1

o Recently I’ve been running minipreps on my cultures first, and if the miniprep has good yield, I proceed with the Maxiprep. Exactly zero of my minipreps have had good yields.

**Things I have tested/replaced:**

**Cells:**

• Competent cells (DH5α home-grown vs invitrogen)

o Transformation efficiencies seem fine.

**Reagents:**

• Every single broth or media (LB, SOC, LB plates)

• Different brands of LB

• Water (distilled water vs. MQ filtered water)

• Qiagen kit

o Qiagen sent a new Maxiprep kit to test, same poor results

o Poor yield regardless of Miniprep or Maxiprep kit

**Plasmids**

• Problem is plasmid-independent. Poor yields regardless of which high copy plasmid is used

• Have tried pBS, pGEM-T, pUC19 vectors. All high copy. Poor yield for all.

**Things that I will test or am currently testing:**

• High salt, lysozyme Maxiprep method

• I have a freezer stock of pBS cells that I will go back to, streak out, and see if yields are any better. I have been transforming cells for most of these preps.

o However, if this works, I am still stuck because I have no freezer stock of pUC19 cells. I NEED a working transformation.

• Chloramphenicol amplification.

o I don’t expect great results from this because the plasmids I am using are already high copy, so chloramphenicol should not increase plasmid production much (if at all). Also, from what I understand, this produces relaxed plasmid.

o Could using relaxed plasmid create any downstream problems? The ultimate fate of most of these plasmids will be restriction digestion, if that helps.

• Next door lab has offered to let me use their electroporator for transformation. Not sure if this would help, as transformation numbers are OK.

**Yields:**

• Minipreps: &lt; 2ug (can expect up to 20 ug)

• Maxipreps: ~50 ug (can expect up to 500-750 ug)

• High copy plasmids used.

• pUC19, pBS, pGEM-T tried. pUC19 has no insert, and was purchased directly from NEB.

**Observations:**

The problem is not with the kits or plasmid purification procedure. The problem seems to be with plasmid propagation, but I’m not sure in what way it’s messed up.

Plasmid recovered from preps is extremely clean, there’s just not a lot of it. No genomic DNA; no RNA; no nicked, linear, or denatured DNA. Therefore, I do not think my plasmid is being chewed up. There is no plasmid leaking through into flowthrough or wash.

**There is some evidence for possible contamination (either by non-plasmid containing E. coli or something else that doesn’t care about Ampicillin):**

• Cultures seem to grow too quickly

• Example: 150 mL culture is overgrown (A600 = 2.5) after only 12 hr at 37C

**Evidence against possible contamination:**

• Ampicillin has been re-made twice, and a new stock bottle purchased.

• All glassware has been autoclaved prior to use, and then autoclaved again immediately after adding broth.

• I have tried multiple autoclaves as well as longer autoclave times.

• Every single broth or media (LB, SOC, LB plates) has been made and remade again and again. For the LB, different lots/brands/formulations have been tested.

• LB remains clear when left on bench (or at 37C) for days or weeks.

**TL;DR:** Plasmid prep yields suck (10x lower than expected). I’m using Amp resistant plasmids. I’ve tried multiple, high copy plasmids, including VECTOR ONLY plasmids (no insert). Problem is with propagation and not with the kit(s). Help me.

PS: Are there any other subreddits or forums that might be able to help me?

I am the third person in my lab to attempt to complement this gene. The first person didn't realize the gene was in an operon, and we are cloning into a 10 kb vector that isn't providing a promoter for whatever goes into the MCS. In fact, this gene is at the end of this operon, so the second person tried to clone the entire operon (4kb) into our vector; again, no success. He went out of the country to study and asked me to try, and of course, I thought I would be a mega-molecular badass and get this construct within two weeks. Complementing this gene is also the last thing that needs to be done before paper preparation time, and I'd really like to get my name on it.

My idea was to amplify the operon's promoter and the gene separately then ligate them together (with the restriction sites in the appropriate places, of course). The restriction enzymes I am using are XbaI and KpnI (which is 75% active in the buffer I have to use). I digest for two hours and my ligations are always 16 C overnight, 1:3 vector to insert ratio. I used my digested vector which I successfully cloned into a month ago (I ran out so I am going to have to prepare another batch). Here are my ligations:

The first was ligating the promoter fragment into the vector. I then PCR purified, ligated the gene fragment in, PCR purified again, and transformed into TOP10 E.coli, selected on Amp 100. I got 13 colonies. A couple had the appropriate sized band but also another fragment that was present when I PCR'd the miniprepped vector and digested the fragment out. I put that vector into my organism of interest anyway, I got 16 Tet/Amp resistant colonies, all negative for my insert, but a few positive for the fragment that shouldn't be there.

My second ligation, I figured, would be more successful. I ligated the promoter and the gene fragments together, PCR purified, then PCR amplified with the promoter's forward primer and the gene's reverse. I ligated that into my vector. I got a ton of colonies. I have screened 50 of them: all negative for my fragment but some had random-ass sized bands.

The last thing I did was put that promoter-gene fragment into the TOPO pCR 2.1 pUC vector. I got a bunch of satellite colonies; no positives. 

Here are some questions: Should I digest my vector and fragments overnight from now on? When I digest my plasmid, should I use CIP? I didn't last time, and everything turned out fine. Just digested, gel extracted, and I got my construct with that after 1 attempt. Arrghh...help me, y'all, and I'll love you forever.",microbiology,1349208553,kehsha,0,1,True,2012-10-02

However, I also think going to grad school is an option for me to. I could see myself being a PhD student way down the line and I know that I would love the research aspect. I have always thought astrobiology would be a phenomenal field to go into, but I don't even know if that's really feasible.


I have taken biotechnology courses and I find genetic engineering fascinating.


Basically, I think my problem is that I like too many things. I have a really hard time deciding what I want to do, and time is really kind of running out on me. What I am asking y'all for is advice! If anyone here could give me advice on what their occupation is (such as how you got there, what you do, etc.), that would be phenomenal. I am open to anything, and I would just like to talk to some people that have already been down that road!


Thanks in advance.

I currently have all my paperwork in as a biology major, but it would be simple to change if needed. The health sciences major appeared to have more microbiology coursework and geared towards a medical research approach, but the biology degree seemed a little more versatile.

The project won neither and she's been bummed a little bit. So, I wanted to help her make a stellar science fair project for next year. I am a recent graduate, however, my expertise is in Sociology. At one point, I majored in nursing and as such had to take intro to micro. I learned a lot in that semester and am considering going back some day to get my bachelors in micro. That being said, my limited knowledge of micro might be just enough to get that coveted blue ribbon. Here's the plan of action so far...
*Teach my cousin how to properly wash her hands and keep from contaminating the samples by using a Bunsen burner to sanitize the area's air. I'll also show her why and how a 70% mixture of isopropyl alcohol is best to sanitize the area.
* Collect samples from various locations like the bathroom, the mouth's of family etc.
*Grow samples on nutrient ager plates made at home or ordered off of the internet
*Isolate various interesting colonies and transfer to new plates for further isolation
*I want to look at them through microscopes to determine morphology but that may be easier said than done. Maybe I could ask a local university for permission to use a microscope under supervision? Or have a friend who is in micro/nursing look at them and determine morphology...?
*Run some basic tests to determine gram +/-, possibly use a blood agar (what other tests would be easy to run at home?)

I have demonstrated leadership, longevity and growth in all my jobs (shown growth through pay and promotions). I have not been able to bridge the gap between all of my career experience and my biology education and land an entry level position in the field of clinical or laboratory research.

My wife and I moved to the Seattle area 2 years ago so because she landed her entry-level position for her dream job. I landed a job through a friend doing warehousing. We both make very little money and I'm not trying to go back to school for an education I already have.

I have tried contacting maybe 10-15 different biotech companies in the area looking for volunteer work to help get some laboratory skills under my belt and perhaps even land a job with a company that I would volunteer at. I know that most places wouldn't appreciate using their employees to train someone that was just going to leave and go work for another company. I did also get a certification in Phlebotomy after we moved over here because most of the medical assistant positions required 1, yet I still have yet to have it yield me any assistance in the job searching process.

I would gladly try and get temp-work through a temp agency but my wife and I make so little as it is that affording rent and bills alone is difficult enough. So that option is a little too risky for her and I right now.

I've been scoping out areas in the buildings that the company currently occupies to try to find a place to work in the meantime.

There are plenty of resources out there regarding supplying a new research lab, and I know about the new lab startup programs that several companies offer (Fisher, Sigma, Corning, etc.).  I have a couple of questions about construction of the new facility, though, and my Google-fu isn't helping me out much with that.  Perhaps it's too weak.

* In general, are there specific materials that the facility must use if it is being used as a research facility (I'm thinking things like flame retardants in the walls/ceilings because of the use of open flames, etc.)?  (This may be one of those questions where the answer is, ""It depends."")

* Are there any minimum dimensions for rooms being used as research labs (namely, ceiling height)?

* What else I should consider regarding the construction of the facility?

It'll be a BSL-1 facility, and I'll make sure to have the standard safety equipment (fire extinguishers, eyewash stations, chemical showers, etc.), of course.

499,Cell Lysis. Undergraduate who needs some help. ,"**Background**
I'm working in a microbial ecology lab and mostly what I work with is [Chlamydomonas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydomonas) At the moment I am trying to take these cells, of which might not be individual cell colonies or a mixture of different organisms, and sequence them to find out what exactly is on the plates. 

**Protocols**
To being I follow this [protocol](http://www.piercenet.com/instructions/2160871.pdf) and I use this [reagent](http://www.thermoscientific.com/ecomm/servlet/productsdetail_11152___11953283_-1) . I don't have a list of my PCR amplification reagents or protocol on hand at the moment I'll post them asap. 

**My Method**
So I take 5mics of lyse N' go and inoculate cells from the plate to the PCR tube. I do this with a pippette tip and just dip or stroke off a colony. I am vigorous with the re-suspension and pipette as well as flick the tube but make sure all of it is at the bottom when I run the PCR (quick centrifuge). After the Lysis PCR, I do a template amplification for 30cycles using 18S ribosomal eukaryotic primers. I use a positive control from DNA that was isolated using this same Lyse N' Go protocol. When I get my results back from the gel, no bands seemed to have amplified from my samples. (I also use a 1% agarose DNA gel with 1xTBE to which I add 1mic of ETBR per 10mils of TBE).  However, my controls worked perfectly. Because my controls come out fine I'm thinking the amplification is fine. By the way I mix everything in a mastermix before adding to the PCR tubes, so every tube receives the same mixture for amplification, including the controls.  

**What I've Tweaked**

**Not Enough Lysis**
My graduate student I'm working under has thought that we use too much DNA for too little lysis and so we've bumped the Lyse N' Go to 20mics and put it through the Lyse N' Go Thermocycler protocol. Then transfer 5mics of this to the PCR amplification mixture. **Didn't Work**

**Inhibitors Preventing Lysis**
Next we thought inhibitors on the cells perhaps prevented lysis from occuring, which we washed with a buffer (I wish I remembered the buffer name; I'll have to get back to you guys). We did this by suspending the cells in 300mics of buffer, vortex then pelletted. Poured out the supernatant and repeated one more time. Then we added 5microliters of Lyse N' Go (haven't done this with the 20mics yet). **Didn't Work**

*I should not I haven't tried both of these together*

**What Else I think May be Wrong**

**DNA Concentration**
It is difficult to assess the amount of DNA I am putting into the PCR reaction because the DNA comes from a microbial colony. Therefore there might be too much or too little, though we have tried to vary the amounts of cells suspended in the lyse N' Go. We do this by eye. No quantitative analysis whatsoever. 

**Expired Reagent**
Possibly the Lyse N' Go reagent has expired, I don't have much experience with this stuff and neither do many people in my lab. 

**Degradation of DNA**
Possibly in the amplification or lysis procedure my DNA is degrading and therefore not showing up on my gel. 

**Important Notes**
This did work the first time we used this protocol to identify Chlamydomonas Pulsatilla and ever since some stuff has worked but it is maybe 1 out of 10 or so PCR reactions. Also for the stuff that did work, I sequenced and they have really dirty sequences that resembled multiple DNA templates for the 18s ribosomal gene. 

**Future Thoughts**
So I'm thinking about doing a wash with a more vigorous lysis. I also might see if the lab could start with new Lyse N' Go. I may also try a gradient of Primer concentrations and then after that I am sort of clueless. 

*Feelings: &gt;_&lt;*
I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has had problems with cell lysis. I know this stuff is suppose to be easy but it is making me doubt my capabilities to be a scientist. Just seeing if anyone has any ideas. Thanks a lot if you got this far reading what I had to say!",microbiology,1363894487,ColorYourPhile,0,1,True,2013-03-21

I'm currently very interested in psycho-pharmacology (which I understand to mean the scientific exploration of how psychoactive substances function in the human brain - I don't know if the term is used like that, but it's how it was explained to me). My knowledge of biology is very limited - I've taken the Biology 101/102 sequence 3 times (twice in high school, once in college; my HS biology professor taught the freshman biology class in almost exactly the same way that she taught the senior AP bio class; I had done gel electrophoresis twice before even setting foot on a college campus), a ""chemistry I for science majors"" and that's it.

If I wanted to get on the road that would lead to a firm grasp on psycho-pharmacology, what steps would you recommend taking and what texts would you recommend reading? I presume I'd need to read a Chem I/II level book, something about organic chemistry, something about cell biology, and...what else?
