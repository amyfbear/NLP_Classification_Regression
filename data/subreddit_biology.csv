Also, I’m poor and can’t even fathom going to grad school, nor am I particularly passionate about a specific area of study within Bio. 

I’ve had some odd jobs here and there but nothing really substantial. I’ve done some parasitology research, pearly mussel field work, and did a small paper on freshwater jellyfish and lake plants. I’m good at Field and microscopy work. 

The issue now is my current temporary job with the State Health Department is now coming to an end and I have no idea what to do next. The Northeast seems to have a terrible job market, especially state/DEC related jobs.

9,All the basics about Immunity," 

***\\mmune System*** 

The immune system is a complicated and intricate system, involving the the protection of the body from infections and antigens. The process has many steps and protocols, and also various cells. It is made up of different networks through the cells, organs and tissue.

***Cells***

Leukocytes, also known as white blood cells, are one of the most important cell within the immune system.  It is stored and produced throughout the body but more specifically the thymus, spleen, and bone marrow, which is the reason why they are called the lymphoid organs. There are also bags of leukocytes, predominantly in the lymph nodes.

The leukocytes travels through our body via the lymphatic vessels and blood vessels, which broadens the area in which it is capable of being present.

The two Basic Leukocytes cells:

*Lymphocytes-* cells that remember and recognize previously invaded pathogens and germs.

*Phagocytes-* cells that eat invading organisms.

A type of phagocyte is *neutrophil*, which also eats/chews up. There are also other phagocyte that have a job for specific invaders.

The two types of Lymphocytes cells are *B lymphocytes* and *T lymphocytes.* Lymphocytes begin in the bone marrow. Either they stay and mature into B cells or leave and mature into T cells. 

*B lymphocytes-* are the bodies intelligence system. Collecting and filing information.

*T lymphocytes*\-Seek out the invaders and destroy them through the information that the B-lymphocytes have provided.

Of course there are many more cells but these are considered the most important.

**Other Terms**

*MHC(Major Histocompatibility Complex)-* Are proteins on the surface of cells to recognize foreign substances.

*Receptor-* “a molecule in a cell membrane, which responds specifically to a particular neurotransmitter, hormone, antigen, or other substance.”-Google

***Immune Response***

1. Pathogen enters body
2. Inflammation
3. Macrophage engulfs and practically digestis invaders.
4. Macrophage displays invader fragments with it’s MHC on its surface.
5. The macrophage acts as it’s antigen presenting cells and combine the non-specific to the specific defense
6. A T helper cell can bind the MHC and has the right receptors binds to the active macrophage.
7. The macrophage will bound the t helper cell through chemical signals.
8. The activated t helper cell will undergo several processes of cell division, producing an extensive amount of newly modified t help cells that are antigen specific t-helpers.
9. They then go in search of attack cells to activate.
10. Resting B cells will also bind antigens to their surface receptors. Similar to macrophage they partially digest it and display it on their surface with MHC as a sign that they are specific to that antigen.
11. The activated t helper with the same antigen specificity will bind to the b cell and activate it using chemical signals.(since all self reactive t cells have been destroyed, no self- reactive b cells can be)
12. The activated b-cells will now divide producing a ""clone"" of identically reactive plasma cells.
13. The plasma cells now produce and sictrite antibodies specifically designed to attack or neutralize the antigen.

***Disorders Connecting to the Immune System***

The disorders from the lack of a functional immune system can fall into four categories.

1. Immunodeficiency Disorders

* In which a part of the Immune System is not properly working or missing.

1. Autoimmune Disorder

* In which the immune system attacks the body's own tissue believing it’s foreign.

1. Cancers of the Immune System

* In which cells in the Immune System grow out of control.

1. Allergic Disorders

* In which the immune system overreacts in a response of an antigen.

Some examples of these disorders are:

Immunodeficiency Disorders: 1&amp;2 are primary    3&amp;4 are secondary(Acquired)

1. *IgA deficiency*, in which the body doesn't produce enough of the antibody IgA
2. *Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID*), is when the body doesn’t produce enough t cells and b cells.
3. *HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome*, is when it wipes out t helper cells.
4. *Immunodeficiencies caused by medications,* is what is seems.

Autoimmune Disorder:

1. Lupus, when the immune system attacks the kidney and other organs.
2. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, is when the immune system attacks the joints of the knee, hands, and feet.

Cancers of the Immune System:

1. Leukemia, is over division of leukocytes.
2. Lymphoma

Allergic Disorders:

1. Asthma, is when the immune system overreacts about ollen, molds, animal dander, or dust mites, which can make the breathing tubes narrow and swollen.
2. Eczema

***Immunotherapy*** 

Immunotherapy is enhancing or hodifing the immune system to specially attack cancer cells and or diseases. 

How immunotherapy can be consumed:

*Orally*: Pills, liquids

*Intravenously*: Injected into vein

*Topically*: Cream to rub onto skin

*Intravesically*: Administer directing into the bladder.

Monoclonal Antibodies can be designed to approach cancer cells in different ways. Many consumed through intravenous injection.

* The antibodies can flag the cancer cell so the immune system can kill it.
* The antibodies carry medicine, chemotherapy, and directly injects it to the cancer cell.
* The antibodies can slow down the grow of the cancer cells by blocking the parts of the cell that enable it to divide.

Non Specific Immunotherapies is giving extra cytokines to help attack the cancer cells.

Types of cytokines created in laboratories are

* *Interferons-*  which can help slow down the growth of the cancer cell.
* *Interleukins-* which can produce more white blood cells and antibodies to fight the cancer.
* *Hematopoietic-* growth influences*,* which may be used to forestall chemotherapy side effects. ",biology,1537172000,PhiIIi9,21,178,True,2018-09-17

31,Genetically Modifying T-Cells to suppress immune responses?,"My Question is specifically in relation to arthritis disease, but some context first. 

As far as i understand Arthritis is an autoimmune disease which involves inflammatory cytokines being released, as well as certain nuclear factors which initiate a signalling cascade that leads to an immune response. Tissue and bone are attacked and become inflamed or degraded and this is the source of pain (vaguely speaking).

I’ve read about CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor) cells which are essentially genetically modified white blood cells that express a specific receptor designed to initiate a signalling cascade for an immune response, when the cell comes in contact with an antigen on the outside of a tumour.

My question is could we modify immune cells in the same way, but to do the opposite? As in instead of helping our bodies identify tumours by creating special cells which find them and initiate immune responses, can we create specialized white blood cells to help suppress the damaging immune activity occuring as a result of arthritis?

48,League of Legendary Cas Enzymes – Cas12a and Cas13a,"https://i.redd.it/e98f5xgz4zm11.jpg

**Cas12a**, the Assassin also known as **Cpf1**, is more precise and specific than Cas9. Due to its smaller size, it can be shuttle it into cells much easier. Its higher target specificity is based on its strong discriminates against nucleotide mismatches. Cas12a also stands out due to producing sticky ends ends after introducing DSB, instead of the blunt ends of Cas9. Sticky ends allow for more successful integration of inserts via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).

Cas12a fused with a reporter molecule acts as Support by searching DNA. The added reporter molecule is activated as soon as DNA that is complementary to the gRNA is found. In fact, Cas12a has already been used to detect viral RNA, and a molecular detection platform based on Cas12a termed SHERLOCK (Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) has been developed.

**Cas13a**, the Mage, also known as **C2c2,** tagets RNA instead of DNA. Cas13a does not permantnetly change the cells genome but cleaves RNAs, and, therefore, acts on the level of gene expression and can knock down protein levels. Its drawback is that it tolerates single mismatches of the crRNA to the target sequence. Cas13a can also be utilised as Support. As soon as target DNA that is complementary to the crRNA is found, a reporter molecule that is fused to Cas13a is activated leading to the emission of a fluorescence signal for instance.

High quality and highly specific gRNA is of utmost importance to take down the nexus, the gene of interest. Eurofins Genomics provides ready for transfection sgRNA and the two-part cr:tracrRNA construct to guide your experiment to success.

So far my GPA is above 3.5, I work in an insect lab pinning and ID-ing, have had a summer technical job collecting data on plants, and am working on an independent research project dealing with aquatic invertebrates and invasive plants. I've made some connections that should be good resume references, and a professor who told me they'd write me a good letter of recommendation when the time comes.

I always had a passion for ecology, nature, and wildlife and am especially interested in insects, plants, and restoration. But the further along I get, the more terrified I become that I won't be able to land a stable job with a livable income focusing on these themes. I worry that my experience is lacking.

My main question is which organism or ecological concept should I focus my next independent research on to help make me employable? I am allowed 2 faculty-advised reseach projects in my program and I want to make sure I make the best choice. Most permanent jobs related to my field I see posted online tend to deal with forest management or GIS. I could probably do a GIS project, but unfortunately my college doesn't have a forestry program or any foresters in their faculty. Other options that fit with my department faculty's expertise include birds or mammals. I think I could also do a project with a member of the Geography or Geology department's faculty.

At this point I'm not sure grad school is an option due to burnout and my age (I'll be 28 at graduation,) and I just want to get my career/life started and get out of the acedemia world. Maybe if I find a master's program in the future that I think will help me professionally I may consider it, but my main concern at this point is employability.

**TL;DR** How can I make the most of my last 4 semesters to make myself as employable as possible? Thank you in advance for reading and for any advice.",biology,1537293302,VanLaux,2,4,True,2018-09-18

73,What would the world be like if birds were bigger?,"I’m currently attempting to write a fantasy novel (set around the sixteenth/seventeeth century), and an angle I found interesting is if the jobs we usually turn to mammals to fulfill (ex. pest control, transportation, heavylifting, pet/entertainment) we replaced them with different species of bird (owls/eagles, secretary birds/ostritches, shoebills/emus, parrots/chickadees). Of course, most of these jobs would require the birds to have evolved to be larger/stronger/more sturdy.

My question is if we go along the lines of them having originally (or later on) evolved to be larger, how do you think they would have changed to combat that? Would their prey change size/defense in turn? Would their habits or habitats be different? Could this happen due to domestication for specific jobs, selective breeding, natural selection, or predatory/migratory/foraging/scavenging needs? For the sake of consistency, let’s say terrestrial birds have become significantly larger (40-50%), avian birds have increased not as much in size (25-35%), and arboreals have slightly changed accordingly (5-20%)

If there’s any other subreddit you think I should ask this on, please let me know.  I’m posting this here because I’d like the opinions of people who study animals and their habits to be first and foremost when designing and designating how the world works.  If you have suggestions for bird species to include (or extinct species that might have survived in this alternate timeline) that would be highly appreciated. I’d like to stick to what would be the most likely outcome, but I wouldn’t mind bending the scientific rules a little if that is the best option. Sorry for the long post, I hope this is a more fun train of thought to think about than a head-scratching one!

75,Enjoying Biology/Microbiology?,"Hey everyone, I’m posting in this subreddit to gain some insight when biology became a “passion” for you guys. I’m currently in my last year in the Microbiology major as an undergrad, and I haven’t really enjoyed it so far...

A little background info, I originally entered college as an ME major. I was that kid who loved to build and create random stuff, and I was always excited about Metal-shop and Wood-shop in school. I was naturally decent at math and science, so it made sense to do engineering. 

During my first year in college I didn’t find ME enjoyable, but I think it was me being immature at the time. I didn’t handle the stress well, and I didn’t take school seriously. 

Switched majors to Public Health (PH), as I started doing ROTC at my school. It was mentioned that PH was a good major to have, since it would have given me a lot of different opportunities in the military. Long story short, got kicked out for medical reasons. I switched majors to Microbiology, as I enjoyed micro lab as a PH major. I thought that was a good choice, but so far I haven’t been too pleased by it. 

Today, I’m currently volunteering as a research assistant (RA) in a professors lab. The work is whatever, I’m not stimulated by what I’m doing. Currently working on configuring a plasmid to have certain genes/proteins. 

Additionally, at the same time I made the switch to micro I was very ambitious. I have done the following in last two years: 

1 year undergraduate teaching assistant for micro and cell bio lab 
1.5 years as a Laboratory Tech at a company

Teaching was fine, I feel happy seeing students being interested and grasping what was being taught. Lab job at company sucked, all just lab maintenance. 

Referring back to me as a RA, I decided on doing this, so I could really have hands work within micro and cell bio. I also want to really learn and grasp the subjects, since I made the decision to study biology in the first place. 

But so far, I hardly ever feel that way. I just feel more lost every day, even after all I’ve done. 

Soooo...after all that I’m wondering if anyone has ever been on the same boat, if things got better, and when did studying/working within biology become enjoyable to you?

88,Climate Does NOT Exist!?!,"*Processing img 26kj5f7z06n11...*

Climate change is a major problem to which we all agree (well, almost all \**wink*\*). Synthetic biology tackles primary greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane and even aims to make use of them. 

In trials, carbon dioxide has been used as substrate for engineered algae and cyanobacteria to produce biofuels such as biodiesel, ethanol and other chemical compounds. Even though these microbes have been modified with various synthetic gene network constructs, issues such as increasing light harvesting and CO2fixation efficiency are still not satisfyingly solved. However, the fast progress in the field of synthetic biology is promising and microbes could substantially contribute to environment protection in the future. And without a healthy environment, we are all done. So jump on the synthetic biology hype train and contribute!

111,Returning to university after dropping out - how to regain motivation?,"In 2012, on the third (penultimate) year of my Zoology BSc degree, I became depressed. It was a bit of a disaster since at the time I had no idea what depression was, but my university was very supportive and allowed me to take a leave of absence. I returned next year and the same thing happened. In 2014 I managed to struggle through until March, whereupon I hit my limit, abandoned my coursework, stopped responding to emails, and went home. I received a letter of termination of studies not long after.

I've since been living at home with my parents, slowly working through an intriguing little potpourri of emotional problems. I got a job teaching English at a local language school run by an acquaintance. I've got back in touch with some of the friends I cut off during my depression and have, if not a thriving social life, then at least a fair amount of human contact.

Now comes the problem. **I want to return to university,** but when I approach the subject my brain goes into full-on existential crisis. It goes like this:

1. I need a degree. (True, but not especially motivational.)
2. I miss studying, desperately. No, let's be honest: I hate exams. More accurately I miss *learning* things, and talking about them with other people who are just as passionate about the things they like. 
3. I'm also not terribly convinced at the thought of studying in my own country, Spain. For the past ten years the research budget has gone through massive cuts, and the university system is rather old-fashioned: lots of subjects, little specialisation, fewer opportunities for practical work and exams up the ying yang. None of these is appealing.
4. ...But for mental health reasons, I'm not sure I should leave Spain even if I could. Loneliness + Scottish winters were a pretty big factor in my depression. I might get depressed at home, but at least there'd be help at hand.
5. After university, I've no idea what I want. I'm not sure I'm cut out for research, but when I think of the future I can't picture any middle steps, just a vast impassable chasm between me and Contented Insert Profession Here, though I know that's not how it works. **How did you get to where you are now? Did you envision having the job you have?**

There's another aspect to the existential crisis, and it goes: do I still want to study animals? I've wanted to ""be a zoologist"" ever since I knew the word existed, but as proven by me, childhood ambitions alone do not a scholar make. Part of me is still very upset. I start flipping through my old notes and I flinch. Since I dropped out I've read very few animal science things, because for a long time it hurt too much to think about. But sometimes I'll be explaining something biological to someone and I talk too loud and wave my hands a lot, and then I realise how *incredibly bored I am* the rest of the time. 

I've started asking myself questions again, though it takes effort (pitched ant battle, alarm pheromonal mayhem, two ants carrying a grass seed across the field, WHY). I read *The Epigenetics Revolution* and summarised it on three notecards which I may never read again and which no other human being will be able to decipher. I am, I think, less sad, but if I want to go back to university I'm going to need a more specific action plan than ""read a book sometimes"".

**What can I do to get back on the horse?**

***

(I'm also still not over my old university - I occasionally daydream about being welcomed back with open arms, and possibly a full bursary and a lifetime's supply of hot chocolate. Termination of studies can be appealed, but it may not be the greatest idea even if it worked as I'd have to return to the scene of the accident, as it were. Burst/reinforce my bubble?)

.

I've been struggling with all this for months. I'd really appreciate any advice or personal experience that you can give me.

I'm lost.,"Hi everybody, I'm currently taking Ecology and Genetics and I'm struggling with the concept of heritability, specifically determining what constitutes as genetic vs phenotypic variance. If a plant clone is grown in 3 different environments, and it has different growth at each, what counts as environmental variation? I understand that the plants growing best in their native habitat is due to obtained genetics, so it wont grow well in the others. But the environment is having a direct impact on the growth of the plants, so why is the environmental variance considered to be a small amount in this instance?  

An example question that really tripped me up is as follows:  
Select the sources of phenotypic variation within a population.  
1. Alleles becoming ""Fixed"" in the population.

2. The presence of two or more alleles for a particular gene.

3. The loss of individuals in a population.

4. A heterogeneous environment that can vary in space in time.

The correct choices are 2 and 4, but why? Why is 2 not genetic variation when it literally implies there is more gene variants??

There is no such thing as moral or immoral biology. Biology is well done, or badly done. That’s all. And **genetic engineering** is a great way to do it well. 

Microorganisms, especially bacteria and yeasts, are perfectly suited for modifications to cheaply create all the compounds that the industry needs to supply us with the conveniences and must-haves that we value so much today... and that we will value even more in the future! It is the way to go. We should use microorganisms for our own personal gain.

The point I’m trying to make is that because of waters high specific heat, it is an effective evaporative coolant as it will take more energy with it upon evaporating, leaving the surface cooler. This then uses less water to release the same amount of energy, than a liquid with a lower specific heat.

https://i.redd.it/0z3o12ce7kn11.jpg

**Cas3**, the Tank, just finds the target DNA and mercilessly shredders it. Cas3 uses its ATPase/helicase activity to unwind DNA/DNA and RNA/DNA duplexes, and, subsequently, its nuclease acts in DNA degradation. 

**CRISPR interference** (**CRISPRi**) and **CRISPR activation** (**CRISPRa**), two Mages, inhibit or activate the expression of genes without introducing DSB. Here, sgRNA is designed to target the region adjacent to the promoter of the gene of interest. CRISPRi sterically inhibits the transcription of the target gene, blocking the expression of the gene without modifying it. Alternatively, CRISPRa can be fused to Cas9 for upregulating the expression of a gene without modifying its sequence.

But these champions are not able to do efficient work without a plan. To take down the nexus, the gene of interest, they need to get there. Eurofins Genomics provides the gRNA to guide your experiment to success. Check out our ready for transfection sgRNA and cr:tracrRNA at [www.eurofinsgenomics.eu/synthetic-sgrna](http://www.eurofinsgenomics.eu/synthetic-sgrna)

196,"Hey /r/biology, if you're interested, I made an open source Research Paper recommender for MedLine papers, check it out. Easy to run in Google Colaboratory.","I made a research paper recommender MedLine papers, try it out! It uses embeddings to represent each paper, so you can get TSNE maps of the recommended papers, recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations for that combo of several papers.

###What is it?

The dataset used is Semantic Scholar's corpus of research paper (https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/ ), and was trained by a Word2Vec-based algorithm to develop an embedding for each paper. The database contains over 2 million papers from MedLine. You can put 1 or more (as many as you want) papers and the recommender will return the most similar papers to those papers. You can also make TSNE maps of those recommendations. 

https://i.imgur.com/B4qdoCC.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/OCgp0MV.jpg

###Where is it?

Github

https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/MedLineResearch2VecPublicPlayGroundV2.ipynb

Or direct look to Google Colab

https://colab.research.google.com/github/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/MedLineResearch2VecPublicPlayGroundV2.ipynb

###What can you do with it ?

You can input a paper, and see what are the most similar papers to it, though the first 30-80 will most likely be papers it has cited or was cited by. I've set it to return 300 papers but it ranks all 2,096,359 papers so you can set it to return whatever number of papers you want without any change in performance (except when it comes to developing the TSNE maps)

Now, the fun part: utilization the embedding properties:

You can see a TSNE map of how those similar papers are related to each other. The TSNE takes a while to process for 500 points (10-20 minutes). You can decrease the number of papers for a speedup, or increase the number of papers but that'll take more time.

You can input several papers by adding the embeddings, and get recommendations for combined papers, just add the embeddings for all the papers (you don't have to average them since the embeddings are normalized ). 

Finally, my favorite part, you can get TSNE maps of the recommendations for the combined papers are well. 

**A great use case would be if you're writing a paper, or plan to do some research and would like to check if someone has already done something similar. You can input all the papers you cited or would like to cite, and look over the recommendations.** 

### How important is this ?

When I was in R&amp;D, we spent a lot of time reinventing the wheel; a lot of techniques, methods, and processes that we developed were already pioneered or likely pioneered. But we weren't able to look for them, mainly due to not hitting the right keyword/phrasing in our queries.

There's a lot of variation in terms which can make finding papers for a particular concept very tricky at times.

I've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented very similar concepts in a previous paper.

Even the Google Brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. A few months ago they released a paper of Swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it.

&gt; ""As has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. The fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough &gt;enough literature search. My sincere apologies. We will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.""

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/dojjag2/

So if this is something that happens to the Google Brain team, not being able to find all papers on a particular topic is something all people are prone too.

Here's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept.

Word2Bits - Quantized Word Vectors

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05651

Binary Latent Representations for Efficient Ranking: Empirical Assessment

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07479

Exact same concept, but two very different ways of descriptions and terminology.

###How do I use it ?

Here's a quick video demonstration:

https://youtu.be/Y-O0wbsg_kY

I tried to make this user friendly and as fast to figure out and run as possible, but there's probably stuff I didn't take into account. Let me know of you have any questions on how to run it or any feedback. If you want, you can just give me what papers you want to analyze and I'll do it for you (look up the papers on https://www.semanticscholar.org/ first )

Here's a step by step guide to help people get started

**Step 1:** 

Run the Section 1 of code in the Colab notebook. This will download the model and the dictionaries for the titles, Ids, and links. 

https://snag.gy/rmoCXO.jpg

**Step 2:**

Find the papers want to find similar papers for at Semantic Scholar https://www.semanticscholar.org

Get either the title or Semantic Scholar's paperID, which is the last section of numbers/letters in the link. For example, in this link

https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Distributed-Representations-of-Sentences-and-Le-Mikolov/9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3

The Semantic Scholar paper ID is '9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3'

Use the title(s) and/or Semantic Scholar's paperID(s) with Section 2 and Section 3 to get the EmbedID from the model. EmbedIDs are how the model keeps track of each paper (not the paperID). 

https://i.imgur.com/0yAQEZl.jpg

The EmbedID is what each dictionary first returns. 

**Step 3:**

In Section 4, insert the EmbedID(s) as the values of paper1EmbedID, paper2EmbedID, paper3EmbedID, paper4EmbedID, etc. 

https://snag.gy/AzeP91.jpg

If you have less than or more than 4 papers you want to analyze, change these lines 

    extracted_v = paper1 + paper2 #+ paper3 + paper4  #Don't need to average since vectors are normalized 
    extracted_vSM = paper1SM #+ paper2SM + paper3SM + paper4SM  #Don't need to average since vectors are normalized 

and create or eliminate the lines of code for vector extraction

    paper1 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper2 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) 
    paper3 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper4 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) 
    
    paper1SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper2SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) 
    paper3SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper4SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) 

Finally, run Section 5 to get a TSNE map of the recommendations. With 300 papers, it takes 15-18 minutes for the map to be produced. 

**Ask any question you have no matter how minor, I want people to use this as quickly as possible with as little time as possible figuring out what to do.** 

### Other details

So it probably doesn't have any papers released in the last 5 months; I think the corpus was last updated in March 2018. Due to the limitation on my computational resources (Google Colab) I had to filter towards more papers with more connections to other papers in the database. A connection is either a citation to another paper in the database, or cited by another paper in the database. I filtered to only include papers with 50 or more connections because Colab would crash if I tried to include more. 

As of right now, the recommender has 2,096,359 papers. I hope to make future versions with more many more papers, including papers from other fields. 

### Feedback greatly appreciated !

I am hoping to get as much feedback as possible. I am specifically looking for cases where you feel that the recommender should have given a particular paper in the top results, but didn't. I am hoping to make an evaluation toolkit that I can use to tune the hyperparameters.

So far I have a great GPA, but other than that I don't have much to boast about (as far as ECs and stuff), but I still have a while until I graduate so I don't wanna assume my GPA will remain as good.

Anyway, I wanna know what my options are if med school doesn't work out. I've done some research on it but I don't feel like I got a good answer as to what career paths are open to Bio majors with a BA. I don't want to get a masters or PhD, so that kind of takes being a college professor off the table (which I wouldn't want to do anyway).

Augmented reality in healthcare has huge potential that will I feel, transform the medical sector; from providing real-time data and assistance during complicated surgical procedures, to supporting aftercare and administration, we’ve only begun to scratch the surface of Augmented Reality’s potential benefits to our health and well-being.

For patients, Augmented Reality can significantly improve the quality of treatment they receive. For starters, the risks associated with invasive surgery can be reduced by keeping the most important information front and center for the surgeon. Secondly, patient education is hugely important when it comes to effective treatment and prevention. AR apps can be used to better illustrate the impact of particular diseases. These apps can also help educate family members and caregivers with regards to the pathology and consequences of particular conditions, making their contribution to the well-being of their loved ones and clients more effective than ever before.  Further, AR technology can also help improve the management of a patient’s aftercare. Augmented Reality apps installed in smart glasses such as Google Glass can act as a digital healthcare assistant in reminding the patient to take their medicine at specific times or by encouraging them to eat better and exercise more.

The possibilities and benefits are endless and developers are coming up with more and more ways of making AR an integral part of health care.",biology,1537860991,GenieGodmother,1,1,True,2018-09-25

I’ve read many mixed reviews, one side stating that ~10% actually land a job in academia after a PhD, it’s publish or perish, funding is tough to acquire etc. 

On the flip side I’ve also read that many grant proposals are lacking direction such as the potential applications of said research, or a detailed plan of how funds will be distributed/spent. I’ve read that some positions receive 500 apps, some receive less than 10. Moreover I can only imagine that many people pursuing a bio PhD weren’t exactly cut out for it in the first place, or perhaps lack the true passion for a field, study obscure and futile subdivisions of bio etc. I assume this because bio is viewed as “the easy science”, and there’s the stigma of “I can’t get a job without a PhD”.

**Area-1: Applied Ecological Genomics and nutritional characterization**

**Title of project**: To understand genomic, nutritional and phenotypic diversity in species X and developing SNP markers associated with a few important environmental parameters

**Objectives:**

1. To understand and analyze genetic diversity in the natural and domestic stands of species X.
2. To understand and analyze nutritional diversity in the fruits of natural and domestic stands of species X.
3. To understand and analyze nutritional diversity in the fruits of natural and domestic stands of species X.
4. To find out genomics markers associated with environmental variables as quasi-adaptation markers

**Expected outcome:**

1. Understand natural variation in genetic, phenotypic and nutritional diversity of the species
2. A few SNP markers (\~50) linked with environmental variables that are known to impact adaptation of the species to high temperature, low moisture, and other important contributors.
3. These markers help us to screen these populations and select 1/10th of them to go into pre-breeding orchards. This data will also be corroborated with nutritional and phenotypic data.

**Tentative time-lines**:

1. Species distribution modelling and mapping using ensemble suitability modelling approaches[\[1\]](http://africanorphancrops.org/wp-admin/post.php?post=1688&amp;action=edit#_ftn1), mapping of environmental diversity within species distribution range, devising collection strategy based on collection gap analysis, establishing collection and logistics protocols, hands on lab work- **6 months**
2. Collection of samples (each ecozone represents proportionate diversity to make a total of \~300-400 individuals with location mapping), sending/bringing leaves and fruits to relevant labs, DNA extraction- **8 months** *(caution- getting samples out of Ethiopia needs to be followed up within Ethiopian framework of law)*
3. Genotyping data generation- **4 months**
4. Genotyping data analysis- **4 months**
5. Nutritional data generation- **4 months**
6. Nutritional data analysis- **3 months**
7. Papers and thesis writing- **7 months**

328,Gene Drive(s) mosquito to extinction and with it malaria,"https://i.redd.it/nbgexrc0tqo11.jpg

CRISPR/Cas9 is used for a gene drive to rid the world of malaria, but on the way the malaria-transmitting mosquito *Anopheles gambiae* has to go. By homozygous disruption of the double-sex gene of *A. gambiae*, the female mosquitos become infertile and are unable to lay any eggs. The male mosquitos on the other hand are not affected. The utilised gene drive construct mutated the targeted gene to 100 % and almost collapsed the populations of caged mosquitos within 7 to 11 generations. These outstanding results could be applied in the wild in about 5 to 10 years. 

A gene drive is a genetic engineering method to propagate one or more genes or gene mutations throughout a population and thereby genetically modify the populations.

329,One of the most important accomplishments of CRISPR-mediated gene editing,"&amp;#x200B;

![img](54rie254cro11)

Utilising CRISPR-mediated gene editing for research to treat diseases is, of course, of paramount importance. However, an also very important topic is chocolate, and securing chocolate production. Chocolate itself cannot be improved, and that is simply the truth, but the cocoa tree’s (*Theobroma cacao*) sturdiness and resistance to diseases could be enhanced. The cacao tree suffers from several diseases that severely damage the global chocolate production. 20 to 30 % of cocoa pods are destroyed preharvest! 

In a recent study, a gene in *T.* *cacao* that is linked to the suppression of the disease response was knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9 (Agrobacterium-mediated transformation). This lead to enhanced resistance of the tree against *Phytopthora tropicalis*, a black pod disease causing oomycete, even though only about 27 % of the targeted gene was found to be deleted! No off-target effects were found (Fister *et al*., 2018; Shi *et al*., 2013). 

This sets the stage to investigate other genes that are associated with the tree’s defence response and could be beneficial for the undertaking to secure chocolate production, which is, after all, of utmost importance.

If you don't want to call it a nail, call it a nail-like extending keratinized structure of something like that if you'd like.

Before you assume that there *must* be some mundane explanation for this that an expert could pull out in seconds, hear me out. What you're seeing in the image above should not be possible according to  current anatomical and physiological understanding about nails/skin. Look at a range of primary sources to confirm this, but a main point is that nail plate tissue (which eventually becomes the hard, dead keratin you recognize as an ordinary nail) is only supposed to come from one area: the nail matrix located underneath the skin at the proximal end of the nail.

404,"[Humor] Exploring the feline Dr. Paula Hutchison's left ear canal and brain in the Rocko's Modern Life fanfic ""Filburt's Postmodern Wife""","[Full story here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15530721)

Part 2:

LATER THAT NIGHT, AT ABOUT 9:00 PM, BACK AT ROCKO'S HOUSE, IN HIS GARAGE...

""Alright, Heffer, listen up; we're going to be needing a good set of suction cups and rubber suits for the upcoming...ahem...SECRET AGENT MISSION that the two of us are about to embark on tonight, among probably other things as well!"" Rocko rather distrustfully explained to Heffer while frantically scrounging through his tool cabinets and toolboxes and slinging out various tools that Heffer reflexively ducked and weaved out of the way of in response.

""Do you think that you can at least be mature and responsible enough to handle them properly for what our plans are, if nothing else?"" Rocko asked Heffer increasingly fearfully as the two of them took all of the things that they needed (probably a lot MORE than they needed, actually), obviously including the Grink Ray, and very illogically stuffed them into the tiny little pockets of their hazmat suits as the two of them walked right back out of the garage and into the living room again.

""Uh, SURE, Rocko! TEE HEE!"" Heffer giggled like an idiot (which he was considerably more of than you might think, let me tell you), jamming screwdrivers into his nostrils and making them stick out like great big sausages for his own selfish amusement while Rocko just irritatedly groaned in annoyed disappointment, grabbed him by the hand and dragged him right back out into the front yard with him.

MEANWHILE IN THE LIVING ROOM AT FILBURT'S HOUSE, WHILE ROCKO AND HEFFER WERE BUSY SNEAKING THEIR WAY OVER TO SAID HOUSE...

""Ah, now THIS is the pathetic miserly joke of a life I've always DREAMED of having if I EVER experienced it!"" Filburt laughed triumphantly and smugly as Hutchison adorably curled up and fell asleep atop his lap while the two of them leisurely sat on their luxurious black leather couch together and watched television. ""MMM, YEAH, RIGHT WHERE I WANT YOU MOST, BABY...""

""Aw, Filbi-Kins, please stop being such a perverted creep, KAY?!"" Hutchison giggled sarcastically, tilting her head into a somehow even more exaggerated angle than before and awkwardly twitching her eyes as her neck audibly snapped from the strain that she had just put on it.

""Great SCOTT, sometimes I really DO wonder what in the actual hell is going on in that crazy little head of yours..."" Filburt teasingly whispered in her ear, causing her to playfully giggle and squirm against him even more while he began lovingly petting her and stroking her hair.

""It's nothing, KAY?! I'm perfectly fine!"" Hutchison teased him, stroking his chin and once again lovingly smooching him on the cheek while Rocko and Heffer crept their way ever-closer to her and Filburt's new pad. For the record, yes indeed; the two of them actually WERE, in fact, wearing hazmat suits in public, and were rather understandably being looked at weirdly and suspiciously by local suburban citizens all the while as a result.

Once Rocko and Heffer had finally reached Filburt's front door, they immediately hid in a nearby bush so that the former of the two could further continue and discuss his current mission briefing.

""Okay, so you ring the doorbell, and then I'll just use this gun here to shrink both of us right down to ant size so that Filburt can no longer see us!"" Rocko whispered into Heffer's ear, having thankfully brought walkie-talkies but also having had literally no reason to use them yet at that moment.

""OH! TEE HEE! It's just like DING DONG DITCH!"" Heffer began laughing and yelling uproariously, his voice thankfully being muffled by the hazmat suit's breathing filter.

""You bet your RUMP it is, pal! Come on, LET'S GO!"" Rocko very excitedly and enthusiastically commanded Heffer as the two of them got onto their tippy-toes and very sneakily approached the aforementioned front door of Filburt's house in a very truly supreme act of dramatic cinematic irony, culminating in the amazingly memorable and exhilarating moment when...Heffer rang Filburt's doorbell?

""OKAY, HIDE, HIDE!"" Rocko frantically whispered to Heffer, setting the Grink Ray into SHRINK mode and very quickly firing it first at Heffer, then at himself.

""WHERE? Oh, I GET IT! DURR HURR!"" Heffer laughed (AMAZINGLY not sarcastically) as he and Rocko, now shrunken down to almost literally microsopic ant size, eagerly waited for Filburt to get off his lazy arse and open the door.

""Honey, somebody rang the doorbell, KAY?!"" Hutchison reminded Filburt as the latter mildly irritatedly pried the former off of himself with all of his might and got back up onto his feet.

""Yeah, sure, and honey also shrunk the kids, what ELSE is new?"" Filburt bitterly snarked to himself under his breath as he drowsily walked up to the front door and opened it. ""Hello? Who's there?"" he exhaustedly rubbed his eyes and groaned as Rocko and Heffer very quickly and thankfully inaudibly came scurrying in between his legs before he could ever even hope to catch sight of them.

""Oh, of course, now I've got my next-door neighbors playing frickin' Ding-Dong Ditch pranks on me, THAT'S what! How INCREDIBLY gosh-darned amusing! HA HA HA!"" Filburt began ranting and raving extremely snarkily as he angrily slammed the door (which very clearly had a DO NOT ENTER sign on the front of it, for the record) right back shut and went into the kitchen to make limeade smoothies.

""MAN, it sure is getting HOT in here..."" Hutchison flamboyantly teased Filburt, stripping the outer layer of her clothing right off and reducing herself to wearing literally nothing but a skimpy bikini and her even skimpier women's underwear yet again while Filburt teasingly wolf-whistled in response, not even wanting to show her how big of an erection he had already just gotten while Rocko and Heffer coated the gloves and boots of their hazmat suits with the former's aforementioned household suction cups and did much of the same.

""Oh my GOSH...she's so HUGE now...it's my wet dream come TRUE..."" Heffer moaned and drooled in arousal, nearly creaming his pants from the mere imaginary vision (let alone the actual sight) of a woman so incredibly beautiful and ""massive"" as Hutchison was from his and Rocko's rather admittedly degrading size perspective at the moment as he and Rocko EXTREMELY excitedly approached the couch that Hutchison was currently curled up and sleeping on while they still had the immensely boner-inducing chance.

""Heffer, you'd better believe that an adventurous opportunity of this magnitude only occurs every once in a whole sodding LIFETIME, if that!"" Rocko ecstatically exclaimed to Heffer, barely even able to keep his composure from how insanely excited he was as he and Heffer used their suction cups to climb their way up the left leg of the couch, then finally make their way over to Hutchison's gorgeously outstretched (and just generally gorgeous) bare soles.

""Honey, would you like your limeade martini with 70 percent alcohol by volume or 80 percent?"" Filburt cocked an eyeglass over at Hutchison and asked her curiously while Rocko and Heffer were busy climbing and clambering their way up her incredibly beautiful and arousing (practically) naked body, of which they had already made it all the way up to the breast point.

""80 percent, baby...now excuse me while I insert my earbuds and listen to some good old-fashioned classical music on my tape player!"" Hutchison yelled loudly (so that Filburt would hear her over the sound of his blender grinding and mashing up the limeade ingredients and imported Rockoco beverage that he had just poured into it), pulling her portable tape player and earbuds literally right out from the gap in-between her boobs while Rocko and Heffer, who were now literally right next to the cat lady's left ear, yelled ""NOOOOOO"" in response as she forcefully jammed her earbuds into her ears and began playing the prelude song to her mixtape, also known as In The Hall Of The Mountain King.

""OH, DEAR SWEET ZORRO, WHAT ON EARTH ARE WE GOING TO DO?!"" Rocko shrieked in panic as he and Heffer frantically clambered their way over Hutchison's ear flap and found themselves standing right there inside the obliviously unaware missus' hearing funnel, pondering over the big question of how they were going to remove the earbud from it while Filburt came back to her with the two martinis he had just made, set them down on the coffee table right in front of the couch, and placed a cozy white blanket snugly on top of Hutchison as she continued blissfully napping without a care in the world.

""DUH...get STRONG, I guess?"" Heffer suggested in a profoundly caveman-like manner, shrugging his shoulders and throwing his arms out beside him to illustrate his profound lack of a better or more sophisticated idea.

""Oh my dear sweet Irwin, OF COURSE!"" Rocko exclaimed, a great big lightbulb appearing over his head and shining so brightly that it exploded into pieces as he jumped sideways onto Heffer's chest, grabbed him by the shoulders and ever-so-ecstatically-and-relievedly shook the living crap out of him. ""HEFFER, YOU'RE A BLOODY GENIUS!""

""For...for REAL?"" Heffer whimpered, breaking out into only the most absolutely adorably awkward of smiles as his eyes watered up and began weeping with sheer joy.

""No, silly, we just have a very important PRODUCT PLACEMENT to make if I do say so myself!"" Rocko chuckled smugly as he and Heffer each pulled out a great big can of Popeye-brand spinach from their pockets and ate the whole damned thing in one big hearty gulp, causing their arm and chest muscles to suddenly grow to gargantuan proportions!

""Repeat after me: AN EARBUD IS AN EARBUD AND THAT'S ALL IT'LL EVER BE!"" Rocko and Heffer ever-so-boisterously chanted in unison, making hilariously exaggerated muscle-straining noises that sounded more like constipation noises than anything else as they each grabbed on tightly to Hutchison's left earbud and began pulling and lifting with all of their combined might, until FINALLY it was going... going...GONE!

""GAH! This is what I absolutely HATE about earbuds, let me tell you; THEY ALWAYS fall out!"" Hutchison sprung right back up into regular sitting position (just as Rocko and Heffer were already tumbling straight through the now-fully-exposed outer opening into her ear canal) and angrily lamented her headphone brand for its extreme incompetence regarding earbuds as she immediately stuffed her left one right back in and waited eagerly for it to transition over into the next song on her playlist...which of course, was none other than Blue Danube.

""WOW...it's so BEAUTIFUL!"" Heffer gasped in amazement at the sight of Hutchison's repulsively thick and revoltingly elaborate stalactite and stalagmite formations of hairy, nasty, occasionally even OOZING AND DRIPPING earwax, his jaw wide open in sheer wonderment at the fact that he was now literally (AND unbeknownstly, allegedly) inside someone else's ear canal, AND with classical music playing in the background.

""Look, you can even see her HEARING VEINS!"" Heffer exclaimed in childlike wonder, suddenly catching sight of a literal wax SCULPTURE that was fashioned directly after classical Greek ones, right down to the whole ""artistic"" nudity part (yes, for the uninitiated, that means his penis was indeed showing).

""Hey, look, there's that good old 'Neoclassical Elizabethan Buildup' that Dr. Bendova kept telling you about! Wonder if she got it from listening to so much classical music all the time?"" Heffer rambled rather disturbingly fascinatedly to Rocko, who was already turning green in the face and trying desperately not to puke from what he could already see embedded into Hutchison's ear flesh all around him and his dearly beloved bestie.

""Heffer, get out your crowbars and be quick about it."" Rocko very flatly told Heffer, already almost completely petrified in terror after his sudden realization that Hutchison's music, combined with his and Heffer's recent (not to mention VERY unwelcome) arrival inside the poor lass' hearing canal, had just woken up a nice big nest-like swarm of ear mites that were more than likely going to try and EAT the two of them!

""So anyway, tell me, my dear sweet kitty-kins; do you ever feel this sudden ITCH in a place where you REALLY shouldn't be feeling it?"" Filburt asked Hutchison quizzically, wrapping his arm around her gently as the local news station went over probably O-Town's hundredth attempted murder/suicide in the past week. ""Like, a 'my mind's telling me no, but my body's telling me yes' type of deal, perhaps?""

""Yeah, but not in my PRIVATE parts like YOU'RE suggesting, you silly GOOSE; rather, it's in my EAR!"" Hutchison groaned rather whinily, trying desperately to resist the urge to stick her finger in there and scratch it.

""HEFFER, QUICKLY, PULL OUT YOUR DUAL CROWBARS WHILE I PULL OUT MY METAL BASEBALL BAT!"" Rocko desperately commanded Heffer in hopes of ensuring their survival.

""Well, how about a wet WILLIE for old time's sake, then?"" Filburt chuckled merrily, wetting his finger with saliva and briefly removing Hutchison's left earbud so that he could forcefully jam said finger into the corresponding ear canal of hers, prompting a rather understandable ""YUCK"" from her and also pushing the mites even deeper into her ear, at which point they immediately begun swarming and attacking Rocko and Heffer!

""BATTER UP, BITCH BOY!"" Rocko yelled furiously as the first mite of MANY lunged straight at him with its fang-like legs and attempted to latch onto his head, prompting him to smash its basically nonexistent face in with a great big horizontal swing of his bat, then disgustingly bloodily and gorily smash it into pieces with several vertical ones.

""LEAVE! MY! FUCKING! DOG! ALONE!"" Rocko yelled valiantly with each downward smash.

""THE WRONG PLACE IN THE RIGHT MAN CAN MAKE ALL THE WORLD IN THE DIFFERENCE!"" Heffer yelled so ridiculously angrily that he actually forgot which order to logically utter his words in as he went on a murderous rampage with his dual-wielded crowbars, smashing every last mite (especially the ones that dared to stand in his way) in one fell sweep (more like one HUNDRED, but you get the idea regardless).

This incredibly gross and violent charade went on like this for at least an entire minute (if not a solid minute and a half) while Hutchison VERY conveniently imagined that it was seriously just her antibodies finally stepping into action against the vile parasitic beasts that dwelt in her hearing organ (is if THEY were actually capable of doing THAT; honestly, however, you can't really blame her for thinking such a thing in a show like this one).

Finally, once Rocko and Heffer were down to the last two mites, Rocko hit the poor unfortunate host's aforementioned Neoclassical Elizabethan earwax statue clean in half by striking it horizontally across the lower abdomen with his bat, prompting him and Heffer to each take their very own respective half of the ridiculously hardened work of art and smash one of the last two remaining bugs into roadkill with it.

""EAT THIS, WRETCHED ABOMINATION!"" Rocko yelled valiantly as he swung the lower half of Hutchison's earwax statue straight down (holding it by the ankles, naturally) and smashed his designated ""last bug"" so ridiculously hard with it (with the statue's groin, no less) that it completely imploded, splattering various different types of grisly guts and bug juice all OVER the place while Heffer readied himself for his OWN grand finisher.

""NOW DO YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A STRANGER IN THE EAR, HAIRY?!"" Heffer yelled maniacally as he also swung the upper half of Hutchison's earwax statue straight down (holding it by the abdomen, of course) and smashed HIS designated ""last bug"" with it, leaving the entire surrounding area around him and Rocko completely splattered and dripping with a mixture of bug juice, bug ORGANS, earwax, and probably kangaroo vomit a few seconds later as well, judging from the rate at which Rocko's stomach was currently going.

""Hold on a second, Heffer; now I REALLY don't feel so good...just gimme a sec- a sec- BLEEEAUUUGH!"" Rocko briefly slipped off his hazmat helmet, grabbed the rotting corpse of a nearby dead ear mite and blood-curdlingly painfully heaved his guts into it.

""See, Rocko? THIS is why us Nah-Teev Ahmer-Eekans ALWAYS get vaccinated BEFORE stuff like this can happen to us!"" Heffer laughed uproariously at poor, POOR Rocko's expense, causing him to roll his eyes like never before as he and Heffer more-than-slightly reluctantly approached Hutchison's beautifully pearly and shiny eardrum.

""Never mind, the itch is all better now, KAY?!"" Hutchison laughed ungodly relievedly, swinging her head into yet ANOTHER ninety-degree angle (while Rocko and Heffer clung for dear life onto her ear hair) as she and Filburt gluttonously guzzled down their ridiculously strong alcoholic beverages and made their way upstairs into the bedroom.

""Well, okay then...let's just hope my kosher weiner syndrome also gets better by the time we reach the bedroom..."" Filburt very awkwardly joked, blushing from ear to ear in the process.

""Your WHAT?"" Hutchison cocked an eyebrow at Filburt and asked him roughly just-as-awkwardly while Rocko and Heffer curiously pondered over how and what with they were going to get past Hutchison's extremely sensitive eardrum without being noticed.

""Rocko, hurry, COVER YOUR EARS!"" Heffer frantically shook Rocko by the shoulder and warned him (in a very faintly whispering tone of voice, so as to avoid being heard by Hutchison) as Filburt, absolutely ENRAGED at how incredibly stupid Hutchison was (much like how Rocko was utterly AMAZED by the fact that Heffer actually WAS, in fact, smart enough to realize which of Hutchison's ears Filburt's voice was coming into her head through), huffed, puffed, and blew the primary defensive gate to the poor kitten's central nervous system RIGHT down.

""MY ERECTILE FUCKING DYSFUNCTION, ASS-FOR-BRAINS!"" Filburt removed Hutchison's left earbud and screamed so ridiculously loudly into the corresponding ear of hers that it not only broke almost every window on the first floor but also COMPLETELY shattered her poor defenseless eardrum into jagged, bloody pieces, giving Rocko and Heffer the perfect opportunity to slip right through the newly made opening into her middle ear, where they then made their way into her even MORE sensitive and delicate inner ear!

""OH MY GAWD, SWEETIE, ARE YOU OKAY?!"" Filburt gasped in shock, lovingly tending to Hutchison's violently bleeding ear with a handkerchief and washing it out with soap, water and various disinfectants in the bathroom while Rocko and Heffer leapt directly into her cochlea/semicircular system and were sucked straight through it as if it were some kind of anatomical water slide, causing Hutchison to groggily and dizzily sway back and forth as she tightly clutched the left side of her head in almost-unbearable pain. ""Don't worry, sugar-pie, this is how cartoon ears are supposed to already be by default..."" he disturbingly calmly reassured her as Rocko and Heffer finally reached the very thing that they had REALLY been waiting so eagerly to see all this time...Doctor Pauline Maurice Hutchison-Shellbach The First's brain, in both the flesh AND the equally beautiful and delicious skull bone!

Part 3:

IN FILBURT'S BEDROOM, WITH FILBURT AND HUTCHISON LAYING BLISSFULLY TOGETHER ON THE FORMER'S QUEEN-SIZED BED WITH STAR-OF-DAVID-SHAPED PILLOWS, AS HUTCHISON'S TAPE PLAYER PROMPTLY SWITCHED ITSELF OVER TO ""CUCKOO IN THE WOODS""...

""Filburt, dear, may I please ask you something?"" Hutchison reluctantly asked Filburt as the two of them nakedly crossed their arms behind their heads (yes, in case you were wondering, Filburt had just then taken off his shell) and laid face-up side-by-side underneath Filburt's very unsubtly Jewish-star-patterned bedsheets, which now undeniably smelt just like her.

""Sure, why not? Every day you discover something brand new, as they always say; by the way, did I happen to mention that I'm in LOVE with your body, to the point where I even have every single shape of every individual part of it photographically memorized?"" Filburt teasingly (and rather profoundly stalkerishly) asked Hutchison, prompting Hutchison to VERY justifiedly bitch-slap his sorry stupid ass right across the face, n-(African American).

""Anyway, as what you just said to me has already IMMENSELY reminded me, do you ever feel as if maybe, perhaps, just MAYBE, our dear and beloved God stays up there in Heaven,"" Hutchison asked, pointing straight up into the sky, ""because he, too, lives in fear of what he has created?""

""Mostly just whenever I read brain-fetish fanfictions."" Filburt replied flatly, violently shaking his head in a desperate attempt to repress his woefully traumatic memories OF said fanfictions.

""Wait a minute...brain-fetish fanfictions...is...IS THAT WHAT I'M BEING MADE THE VICTIM OF RIGHT NOW?! OH, DEAR GOD, IT REALLY IS, ISN'T IT?!"" Hutchison gasped and covered her mouth in shock, the pupils of her alarmingly wide-open eyes suddenly becoming nearly microscopic dots even despite how dimly lit the bedroom was as she suddenly began to quite possibly realize what was REALLY going on here (inside her head, to be exact).

""You BET it is, mister!"" Heffer laughed uproariously as he and Rocko clambered their way up the outer frontal lobe of Hutchison's suddenly powerfully electrified brain, once again thanking the lord for their shock-proof rubber suits as they finally reached the very tip-top of her now-completely-defenseless cerebral cortex.

""Oh, come on, you're just IMAGINING things; it's all in your HEAD!"" Filburt chuckled smugly, slapping Hutchison forcefully on the back in truly classic ""father pulling son's leg"" fashion as Hutchison audibly gulped and trembled on the bed, with her arms widely outstretched beside her and her pupils STILL constricted into nearly invisible dots as Rocko and Heffer finally found the secret entrance hatch atop her brain and jumped right in without even a single care in the world for what they could potentially do to the poor nurse's mental health (well, at least as far as Heffer was concerned; Rocko, on the other hand, was naturally just about as shitlessly scared as you can probably imagine, and also just about as much so as his poor head-intrusion VICTIM was, for that matter...)

(One obnoxiously long ""WHEEEEEE"" from Heffer as he and Rocko gleefully and somewhat terrifiedly slid their way through the shockingly exhilarating secret-entrance tube slide that just so happened to be built right into Hutchison's brain later...)

""My GOD, Heffer, would you BELIEVE it?! THIS IS IT! THIS IS REALLY IT! DOCTOR PAULINE THEODORE MAURICE HUTCHISON-SHELLBACH EASTWOOD THE FIRST FELINE LADY'S BEHAVIORAL CONTROL CENTER!"" Rocko screamed in both absolute terror and thoroughly fascinated amazement at the same time, twirling around on his heels, placing the back of his hand across his forehead and nearly passing out from sheer over-excitement (not to mention sexual arousal from how scrumptiously spongy and wrinkly her brain most certainly was indeed).

""Couldn't you just call it...oh, you know, Hutch's BRAIN?"" Heffer asked him.

""Meh, it wouldn't entertain the viewers even NEARLY as much."" Rocko admittedly somewhat embarrassedly shrugged his shoulders and replied as he and Heffer stared in awe at the astonishingly beautiful network of neurons and synapses contained within Hutchison's breathtakingly glorious central nervous system.

""Come on, let's take care of...AHEM...business, shall we?"" Rocko sighed, grabbing Heffer by the arm and dejectedly dragging the poor fat bastard along behind him as the two of them alarmingly quickly approached the massive central control (super)computer that also just so happened to be built right into Hutchison's brain (lodged into her frontal lobe, to be exact), only to find, much to their dismay when they attempted to turn the damned thing on, that there was a great big VIRUS ALERT message flashing on the screen!

""Ooh, does this mean we get to play Dr. Mario?"" Heffer asked Rocko excitedly.

""NO, YOU DAMNED FOOL, IT MEANS THAT THERE'S YET ANOTHER GOD-DAMNED PARASITE LIVING IN HERE, FOR FUCK'S EVER-LOVING SAKE!"" Rocko once again leapt sideways onto Heffer's chest, shook him violently by the shoulders and yelled at him in frustration...only to immediately stop dead in his tracks, with him and Heffer both diluting their pupils into ludicrously tiny little dots as the inside of Hutchison's brain began to short-circuit and vibrate intensely due to that very same parasite's presence within it while the music that was being transmitted directly into Hutchison's brain through her earbuds suddenly switched straight from Cuckoo In The Woods to the Moonlight Sonata Third Movement.

""I like to eat my unborn chicken voices with disembodied frog scrotum while sucking on purple lemons, KAY?!"" Hutchison involuntarily crossed her eyes in mismatched directions, wildly swung her razor-sharp hook hand all over the place and nonsensically rambled to Filburt, who was already horrifiedly trembling underneath his blanket (admit it, you would be too), then tilted her head and ear-piercingly shrieked the last word of her sentence RIGHT at the EXACT moment at which the aforementioned parasite bursted out from the inner floor of her brain!

""GYAAAHHH!"" Rocko and Heffer alike both screamed in such utterly pants-shitting horror that their OWN brains (along with their eyeballs) literally popped right out from their heads, then took off running like they had NEVER taken off running before!

""You work in Saddam Hussein's rainbow-colored chocolate factory in Heaven, right? Does that not make you a HYPOCRITE?"" Hutchison merrily, cross-eyedly sang, buck-nakedly chicken-dancing and cartwheeling all around (and across) the room while the parasite (which was actually a giant HOOKWORM, by the way, as if THAT makes any sense whatsoever outside of the obvious pun context) burrowed itself ravenously into her logic center.

""You know, I ENJOY severe head pain; it's like a good Chinese dinner shared with a blind, deaf, birth-defected, wheelchair-bound, African Asian American Icelandic Australian, furry, autistic, trans, hermaphrodite, Republican, feminist, poly-gender-queer ostrich with only one testicle, three nipples, two vaginas and every single fetish in the entire known universe!"" Hutchison tilted her head into all KINDS of absurd directions, did jumping jacks and backflips and Michael Jackson twirls/moonwalks (oh my) every which way that she knew how and began rambling her head off (although thankfully not LITERALLY this time) as the worm made its way through her neural network and attacked her social justice moderation center with all of its might.

""Oh, for CRYING OUT LOUD, Hutchison, WHAT IN THE ACTUAL SEVEN NAMES OF FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!"" Filburt yelled irritatedly at Hutchison, briefly bringing her back into reality and loosening the worm's grip on her poor, poor brain as it eagerly readied itself to fly straight toward Rocko and Heffer with its mouth as wide open as it could possibly go and straight-up devour them both in one fell gulp.

""Okay, this is it, Heffer; MAKE MY BICYCLE AIR PUMP GROW!"" Rocko yelled at Heffer (so that his voice wouldn't be drowned out by the sound OF said full-blast motorized air engine, which he had somehow miraculously plugged into one of the numerous wall-sockets contained within Hutchison's brain and turned on at the EXACT same moment at which Hutchison had pulled out a fully revved-up chainsaw from underneath Filburt's bed and sent him frantically running out of the house, screaming at the tops of his ever-loving lungs and desperately dialing 911 all the way) as he coated the entire tube-shaped metal nozzle of the device with the world's strongest superglue (luckily still having their big, bulky muscles from before, naturally) while Heffer used the Grink Ray to make the device EXACTLY big enough so that its nozzle would fit perfectly into the creature's gaping, ravenous, completely mindless maw.

""SUCK ON THIS, DICKHEAD!"" Rocko and Heffer both yelled in unison, holding on tightly to the device's now-massive nozzle and aiming it directly at the hookworm's mouth; of course, naturally, by instinct, the hookworm attacked the nearest moving and noise-making thing that it saw, which in this case WAS, in fact, the nozzle!

""Look out, Heffer; this ain't going to be pretty..."" Rocko nervously warned Heffer, once again turning sickly green around the gills at the mere THOUGHT of what was undeniably about to happen as the worm, with its mouth now hopelessly stuck onto the nozzle of the loudly roaring and vibrating device, became progressively more swelled-up and inflated...and more...and more...and more...until finally...FINALLY...

KA-BLAM!

The worm burst from over-inflation in classic Dig Dug style and violently exploded into a literal shit-storm of gooey worm guts and alien juice all over both Rocko and Heffer AND the inside of Hutchison's brain itself, thankfully restoring her mental faculties back to (relatively) normal as our so-called ""heroes"" unplugged the device and returned it back to their hazmat suit pockets but also bringing the police straight to Filburt's front door and causing both Heffer and Rocko alike to (also violently) blow chunks all over the floor OF said brain!

""OH, DEAR! BAD ME, BAD ME!"" Hutchison (who had already followed Filburt halfway across the house in the form of interpretive tap-dance, grinning her trademark slasher grin all the while) gasped in shock at the very sight of the running chainsaw in her hands, immediately shutting it off and stuffing it right back under Filburt's bed.

""Well, THAT was certainly something."" Rocko and Heffer both exhaustedly whispered to each other in unison as they both fainted head-over-heels onto the floor (of Hutchison's brain) and passed out for the next roughly five minutes or so in a fit of post-traumatic stress disorder while Hutchison finally took out her earbuds and put the tape player away once and for all.

ABOUT SIX MINUTES LATER, AFTER FILBURT HAD FINALLY FINISHED EXPLAINING HIMSELF TO THE POLICE AND THEY HAD FINALLY FINISHED CONFIRMING THAT THERE WAS, IN FACT, NO LONGER ANYTHING WRONG...

""Alright, Hutchy, whaddaya say we make some of that good old hot, steaming, birds-and-the-bees LOVE to each other tonight?"" Filburt teasingly asked Hutchison, reaching underneath the covers of his bed and sensually fondling her boobs and causing her to loudly squeal and giggle ""THAT TICKLES"" in response while Rocko and Heffer immediately hacked their way into Hutchison's central control computer with only THE absolute most malicious Cheshire Cat grins that you could possibly imagine for the given situation plastered onto their faces from ear to ear.

""Heffer? Let me ask you something, and let me ask it REAL GOOD: Are you thinking what I'M thinking of doing with good old Hutch's thinking muscle right now?"" Rocko asked Heffer in a rather ominously seedy and perverted tone, already drooling luridly at the mouth while Heffer also did much of the same.

""Huh? Whaddayahowa?"" Heffer shrugged his shoulders and absentmindedly pretended not to have been listening.

""ARE YOU GAY OR ARE YOU NOT, HEFFER? IT'S A VERY FUCKING SIMPLE QUESTION!"" Rocko yelled infuriatedly at Heffer's (fake) incompetence while Heffer nervously bit his lip and trembled in sexually confused fear, not quite knowing HOW to answer Rocko's question himself.

""Well, umm...I guess you could say...well...um...uh..."" Heffer nervously stammered and fidgeted, twiddling his fingers together and mockingly muttering ""heh heh, OH MY"" to himself.

""FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, SNAP OUT OF IT, YOU GOD-DAMNED BLOATED, BRAINLESS, BLITHERING BUFFOON, I MEAN FUCK!"" Rocko snapped yet again at Heffer, bitch-slapping him RIGHT across the face in glorious slow-motion so that the viewers could extremely vividly see every last miniscule droplet of spit flying out of his mouth.

""Well, I suppose you could say...yes AND no?"" Heffer sighed, regretfully blushing bright red in the process as he admitted what he considered one of his deepest, darkest secrets to Rocko.

""Well then, I'm only going to ask it one more time, and one more time only: ARE YOU THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING?"" Rocko asked Heffer even MORE eagerly and droolingly than before.

""YOU BET YER GAWSH DAYUM KANGAROO PRO-STATE I AM! YEE-HAW, N-(AFRICAN AMERICANS)! NOW GEET OFFA MAH LAWN BAY FOR AH FAHHER THAYS SUM-BAYETCH!"" Heffer pulled out a sawed-off shotgun, played horsey with the assistant passenger's chair for Hutchison's central control computer and yelled at the tops of his lungs, briefly imitating his original Southern Texas accent in a terribly hypocritical mockery of Republicans.

""HEFFER, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, IF YOU FIRE THAT GOD-FORSAKEN THING IN HERE, IT COULD LITERALLY KILL THIS FUCKING BRAIN'S OWNER! DO YOU WANT THAT? HUH? DO YOU?!"" Rocko yelled at the tops of his lungs as he pounced directly onto Heffer and initiated a classic Looney-Toons-style ""dust brawl"" between the two of them.

""Say...Filburt, did you HEAR something?"" Hutchison asked Filburt curiously. ""Something related to the true philosophical meanings of algebra, calculus, trigonometry and the entire mathematical universe as a whole, perhaps?""

""Nope, just completely useless bullshit."" Filburt snarkily replied as Hutchison suddenly rolled out of the bed and walked right out of the room. ""Hey, where the hell are you going?""

""It's a SURPRISE, you cheeky boy!"" Rocko- I mean, Hutchison briefly turned around to face him, winking seductively at him in the process. ""You LIKE surprises, don't you? Especially EROTIC ones, I'll bet..."" she briefly continued teasing him and then sexily slunk off into Filburt's basement, her beautiful yellow ass bouncing back and forth AND up AND down all the while.

""Somebody please pinch me; I swear to GOD I'm dreaming right now...there's seriously absolutely NO WAY that someone like ME was able to score THIS ludicrously hot of a wife..."" Filburt disbelievingly thought to himself, his boner already so big that it was poking right through the top of his underwear by quite a bit.

A FEW MINUTES LATER...

""Look what MOMMY brought home, sweetie!"" Hutchison, who was now dressed in a mouthwateringly sexy bondage suit (in which she was still pretty much completely naked except for her newfound nipple rings, black leather combat boots, black leather fishnet leggings AND black leather body straps, as well as her spiky black arm/neck bands), walked back up the stairs into Filburt's bedroom with a great big chest containing pretty much every single sex toy in the book.

""I lie uncorrected."" Filburt muttered disbelievingly to himself, his jaw firmly agape as he briefly lowered his glasses and then put them back on, then smacked himself brutally across the face several times to make sure that what he was seeing WAS, in fact, actually real after all.

""Hey, keep doing that, you fucking pathetic bespectacled retard! I LIKE it when you do that, you god-damned miserable Jewish PEST!"" Hutchison VERY insensitively laughed and jeered at Filburt, causing Filburt's already rather notably massive boner to grow even further as a result.

""Hutch, you are seriously everything I've EVER dreamed of, you know that?"" Filburt VERY awkwardly moaned with pure unadulterated happiness, once again literally weeping from sheer joy as Hutchison continued to slowly but surely advance toward him, now COMPLETELY under Rocko's and Heffer's control.

""KEEP DREAMING, MOTHERFUCKER."" Rocko and Heffer both uttered in unison into Hutchison's voice-control microphone with sadistically smug and condescending smirks, at which point Filburt was officially, to say the LEAST, having the absolute best night of his entire life.

Part 5:

Once Filburt and Hutchison had finally returned everything back to its right place and completely passed out together on the former's bed from sheer sexual exhaustion, Rocko and Heffer got out their video camera and plugged it right into the latter's central control computer, with pretty obviously malicious intent if I do say so myself.

""Alright, the recording's officially saved onto this computer now, so if we just download it onto my digital video camera via USB like SO..."" Rocko began monologuing as he typed and typed away on Hutchison's brain keyboard, searching frantically for the new video file that the two of them had just created in her memory banks.

""You know, this type of stuff REALLY shouldn't be existing to this extent in the nine-""

""SHH!"" Rocko loudly shushed Heffer, slapping his left hand over his mouth to silence him while sorting through a whole myriad of traumatic childhood memories with his right.

""Alright, so here's all of the countless times she was raped and molested by her parents whilst growing up...that one time when she literally got her entire right hand cut off by her parents just because she was caught fingering herself with it...the countless members of the Kankerous Koala Klan that she's ended up having to kill in self-defense with the help OF her hand hook in order to avoid being raped AND burned at the stake by them...ah, here we go, our new voyeuristic sex tape between her and Filburt!"" Rocko laughed rather uncharacteristically cold-heartedly (despite the fact that he was actually emotionally DEVASTATED beyond belief on the inside) as he excitedly clicked on the aforementioned sex-tape file and hit the DOWNLOAD TO CAMERA command.

""So I guess that video's IN the camera now?"" Heffer asked confusedly, scratching his head.

""Yep, it sure as hell IS!"" Rocko cackled evilly, briefly testing his new video to make sure that it actually worked on the new device that he had just transferred it to before finally returning both the camera itself AND its USB downloading cable into his pockets and quickly erasing the original file from her memory banks before she could wake up and tell Filburt about it.

""Oh, come on, Rocko, shouldn't we also erase those horribly fucked-up childhood memories of hers so that she'll be able to sleep better at night?"" Heffer asked Rocko worriedly, ever-so-slightly tearing up out of sheer unbridled sympathy for the poor, POOR little kitten.

""Oh, COME ON, Heffer, who CARES if she's batshit crazy? At least it'll help her to break up the freaking MONOTONY that suburban life often entails! Come on, we've got PLACES to be for fuck's sake!"" Rocko yelled irritably at Heffer, also making a surprisingly good point as the two of them hastily made their way over to the secret exit at the back of Hutchison's brain.

""Like WHERE, might I ask?"" Heffer angrily stood up to Rocko for once in his lifetime, grabbing him by the back of his hazmat collar and lifting him up (yes, with exactly one hand; his right one, to be exact) so that he would have no other choice but to make straight eye contact with him.

""Uh...well, you know, bed and then the local movie store..."" Rocko depressedly sighed, his ears and tail alike drooping in undeniable shame as the two of them snuck back out of Hutchison's head by going into her nose and purposefully getting themselves sneezed across the bedroom by her, then quickly snuck their way back out of Filburt's house through the currently-unused doggie door that had already been built into the back door just in case, used the Grink Ray to grow themselves back to normal size and hastily headed back home to go to much-needed sleep in their OWN beds before Filburt and Hutchison could catch sight of them.",biology,1538234026,PleasantPersonality0,1,1,True,2018-09-29

450,A body that could store oxygen,"Hi all, not sure if this is the right place to post this. If not, apologies. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a writer  designing an alien species and one thing I thought would be interesting to add would be the ability to store oxygen, so they wouldn't need to breathe it throughout the day. It would be something like a large intake at certain times of the day followed by a large ""exhale"" of components of the air they didn't need. Then they would have a sack, or a bunch of smaller sacks, that would fill up and their body would use it same as ours does, until they ran out and had to intake again. 

Some questions:

1. Would this be an evolutionary ""feasible"" design? 
2. Would one large sac/bubble or many smaller ones make more sense?
3. Assuming a similar use of oxygen as humans, how many times per day, based on how much they could logically intake and hold, would they need to ""breathe""?
4. Are there other things in the air, once again assuming similar to human needs, that they would need to store from breathing?
5. What would be a logical way of intake and the follow ""exhale"" besides through the mouth?
6. Are there any complications this would add to a body that I'm missing?

Thank you in advance for taking the time to read and help me out.

I appreciate anyone versed in this subject taking the time to read all this, and not just skipping to the end!

  I just Googled what some ""boffins"" would call a ""dumb AF question"": ""Does all life on Earth contain DNA?"". Mostly this question came from a memory of an old documentary where some ""red rain"" fell in India, containing what looked like plant based cellular remains. The Biologists said ""It doesn't contain DNA, therefore it can't be from Earth"". Now I don't necessarily believe in aliens as such, but I do think we'd be pretty closed minded to assume that in the trillions and trillions of star systems (each with their own planets), there could be zero possibility of ""life promoting conditions"". If like some scientists have said ""life on Earth was mainly possible because of its distance from its star"", then that surely means millions of other planets could sustain life, just not made of the same ""building blocks"" as the carbon based, oxygen reliant, glucose burning type. Anyway I've gone way off track.


  Why do some scientists seem to believe that because some viral organism use purely RNA (and no DNA), they aren't alive? That doesn't make any sense to me, as a layman.

463,How does the CRH work in the PVN and is it connected to other parts of the brain?,"I understand there is CRH and CRHR1 mRNA in brain tissues like amygdala, hippocampus, PFC etc 
But from reading on wikipedia and many other pages they always and Only state that CRH is released in the PVN, how come? Does the hypothalamus depending how much CRH it secrets it signals the other regions were CRH is made and how much to make or is the other tissues not dependent  on it? how does it work ?

here is my theory but im sure it is wrong:

So my theory is  CRH mRNA in the PVN leads to   CRH and CRHR1 activation. The hypothalamus has a role in Social defeat/Fear processing etc. So these two compounds together (CRH-CRHR1) would increase activity in the areas in the hypothalamus that control Fear processing/social defeat. Cortisol inhibit CRH production in the hypothalamus. However, in the amygdala a brain region involved in the behavioral stress response cortisol increases CRH. So could it be that  excess CRH even tho ACTH and Cortisol should inhibit it in the negative feedback ,once CRH is released the cortisol will inhibit it but it will also increase CRH in the amygdala and thus CRHR1 activation in the amygdala(possibly in the PFC and hippocampus too?) leading to anxiety even tho there is a negative feedback, In this case the negative feedback only works if there is no excess CRH being made in the PVN. Becuase if there is too much CRH being made the cortisol will always increase CRH in the amygdala theres no getting away from that. I believe there is CRH mRNA made in the amygdala etc but they rely on how much the hypothalamus is making so if the hypothalamus PVN is in balance so would the CRH also be in other places .

My second question is about metabolic rate in a cold climate. In an exam question that i had, an example was used where the body temperature was below norm in a cold environment. The rate of respiration was said to decrease. When i looked it up, i found other articles stating the same occurrence.

506,Who wants to be a billionaire?,"If Theresa May offered you £60, what would you spend it on?

I doubt your first reaction would be to say: ‘Theresa! No! I insist! Save up and put it towards something special.’ Yet, through the medium of tax, this is in essence what we have said.

As a result, she has an extra £4.1 billion to spend on that ‘something special’. 

In 5 years, she will have an extra £20.5 billion to spend.

Now £20.5 billion goes a long way. If she so wished, she could buy every team in the English Premier League, and have about £5 billion left over. 

I’m sure there would be uproar if she did decide to do that though.

Instead, the Prime Minister and her Conservative colleagues have decided to put that money towards the NHS, with the intention of improving our health care system. The investment will fund a 10 year forward plan that aims to increase opening hours of GPs, reduce waiting times and improve overall care. 

It is nigh-on-impossible though to find out exactly how much the NHS spends on public health care. I have tried, and the best guess I have come up with is £125 billion. It is harder still to work out what this money is spent on. So with all the uncertainty surrounding funding, employment and Brexit, it is no wonder that people are concerned about the future state of our health service.

But, can we truly expect all the problems to disappear by simply throwing money at them?

No, probably not. But the stability and performance of the NHS *can* be improved if we throw money in the right places. The trouble is deciding where those places are.

Some argue that investing in technology and de novo approaches to treatment may be the way forward. Programmes such as Invention for Innovation and Research for Patient Benefit award funding to research projects that investigate and develop potential new technologies for use by the NHS. Such projects have since been tried and tested in emergency departments across the country, and have proved not only effective, but financially cheaper in the long term. 

Revolutionary technologies may be more expensive initially, but if they can be used to improve treatment efficiency and efficacy, then maybe the immediate sacrifice is worth while. One example is Versius – a robot that can be controlled remotely to conduct keyhole surgery in patients with problems such as a hernia. An exciting prospect to be used from 2019, it required £75 million to develop and will cost the NHS around £6 million to set up and install, not to mention the training of surgeons and the cost of maintenance. 

Introducing new medicines and trialling new drugs can also be an expensive outgoing. Ultimately a longer and healthier life is the aim, and the only way to achieve this is to advance and introduce new methods and treatments.

Immune checkpoint therapy, a novel cancer treatment at-the-moment sparingly implemented by the NHS to treat melanomas, yesterday won the Nobel Prize for Medicine. It is not yet a common therapy in the UK, but with more funding and clinical trials, there is hope that it can play a major role in future cancer treatments and cures.

If we can consistently implement and develop innovative methods such as these, then we may begin to see health improvements. But responsibility must also be put on us, the recipient of such treatments, to reduce our dependence on the health service by adopting a healthier lifestyle. 

The UK is home to the third fattest population in Europe, with over 27% of people estimated to be obese. And with mounting research into links between obesity, diabetes and cancer, it is reasonable to say that treating the country’s weight issues could have knock on benefits. 

Most of us live within reasonable distance of a natural outdoor area, whether it be a park, common or woodland. So perhaps a main reason behind our declining health is that we are not making the most of our country’s natural landscape. The following question was put to me at university: If we invested money into conservation of our wildlife, would we see an improvement to our health? 

The result was a resounding yes. Simple things such as spending an extra 30 minutes a week in a natural open space can reduce the prevalence of depression, or participating in so-called ‘green exercise’ can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. It can be helpful too to take heed of healthier lifestyles: the Japanese practice of ‘Shinrin yoku’ or ‘forest bathing’ has been suggested to boost wellbeing in no end of ways. So maybe some attention should be directed to promoting the use of our outdoor environments to reduce the strain on the health service?

Clearly there are immediate problems that need to be tackled, and some are being addressed promptly. Last week, it was reported that £9 million will be set aside to purchase and store ambulances built in Germany to ride the threat of a no-deal Brexit. Today it was announced that £240 million will be injected into winter’s social care budget to sustain home medical support in order to free up hospital beds. 

The ideas I have put forward will not silence critics forever, or probably even for a week, but they can go someway to reforming our NHS and improving our nation’s health. There are endless projects that require funding and numerous possibilities that can be explored: I have only touched upon a couple. 

Deciding how to spend your money, even if it is only £60, can be a tricky task. Imagine deciding how to spend other people’s money. Imagine deciding how to spend £125 billion of other people’s money. ",biology,1538508853,JordanChamp14,1,1,True,2018-10-02

513,corticotropin-releasing hormone in the brain,"Im trying to find out where in my brain I have overactive excess CRH-CRHR1 binding. CRH binds to CRHR1 receptors and activates them. So reduce CRH and you get lower activity of CRHR1. Is there anything else that binds to CRHR1 or is it mainly CRH? I heard something about urocortin but is that not common?
I have narrowed it down to these places: Prefrontal cortex, Hippocampus , Amygdala &amp; hypothalamus. 
Now all these 4 are part of the limbic system system. Is there any other places im forgetting that has a role in anxiety that produce CRH?
So how would I find out where I have excess CRH being made? From my intuitions it feels like it is the hypothalamus PVN. That is also where I feel headache/pressure in my head but then again these other brain regions are very close so it is difficult to pin-point but I feel the pressure right behind my eyes.
They all produce CRH and CRHR1 mRNA but the hypothalamus produces the most.I don't think I have excess CRH/CRHR1 receptors but rather I produce too much CRH which activates them, if that in the long-term creates more of the receptors I don't know.
Would decreasing CRH mRNA in the hypothalamus PVN also decrease CRH in these other places I mentioned? 
If I remember right the hippocampus,amygdala,PFC have both excitatory and inhibitory connections with the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. So could that mean the hypothalamus is the deciding factor on the CRH produced in these other places depending how much the Hypothalamus makes? I also remember when CRH is produced which then sends ACTH and Cortisol the cortisol crosses the blood–brain barrier and activates specific receptors in limbic brain structures and in the cortex. 
Here is a quote from an article:
''Another surprise was that CRH secreted in the paraventricular nucleus goes to more places in the brain than originally thought — including areas that control the behavioral stress response.''
https://www.psypost.org/2016/09/neurons-in-the-hypothalamus-play-a-previously-unknown-role-in-triggering-anxiety-44767
The hypothalamus also has a role in Fear processing/Social defeat so could these be increased during excess CRH in the PVN and which increases CRH production in other regions of the brain?
Becuase mRNA can't travel from the PVN to the amygdala , PFC and hippocampus , So what did the article mean when they said ''CRH secreted in the PVN goes to more places in the brain than previously thought? - including areas that control stress response'' . Do they mean the Adrenals/thyroid etc? 
I just want some clarification and explanation on this.

633,Very important question that is essential for my survival.,"TLDR at bottom

In my biology class the teacher showed us a ""magic canister"" or whatever you want to call it, it was basically one of [these](https://www.brunnebymusteri.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fladerblom-saft-dunk.png)

What was special about this canister you may ask. Well let me introduce another picture that will absolutely flabberghast you because of my insanely good photoshop skills,

[This](https://i.imgur.com/pyDreO6.png) is the contraption that is making me question life in it of itself.

The image might be hard to understand so i'll try my best to explain.
The whole canister is opaque, it's wrapped in something unidentifiable. No way to see through and observe what sorcery is making thing work but whatever. There's a funnel in the cap and a small plastic bit sticking out of the canister.

So now that you know what we can see i'm gonna move on to the mechanics of the canister. When the teacher inserted a liquid of whatever viscosity, temperature, acidity.. you name it all that came out of the small plastic tube was a pink water like fluid with a ph of roughly 6-7. BUT WAIT, there's a twist, water did not come out every time he poured something in. Some times only a couple of drops would come out and other times an equal amount to the one put in or even more.

Personal hypothesis (flawed):
I first believed that there was some sort of weighted plate separating two sections of the canister so that when you would add weight on top of it it would proceed to push liquid out of the plastic tube. Assuming this mechanism doesn't lag behind or freeze up it is out of the question because of the different amounts each times.

Absolutely no one in my class has solved this yet and it's been several weeks. The teacher won't say what makes this canister work so now I need your help.

TLDR: Teacher gave us assignment to find out how he could pour whatever liquid(different ph, viscosity, temperature) into a canister but only a pinkish liquid would come out that would have a static viscosity, same temperature and a ph of roughly 7.

I have created a proof of concept in Python with numpy and matplotlib. 
Essentially, there are two lattices, one for the lattice gas automata and one for the cellular potts model. 
Cell sites in the potts model are interpreted as solid boundaries by the lattice gas automata. 
Cells are not allowed to be copied to lattice sites containing fluid, which conserves the fluid quantity. 
Right now, the potts model uses simple volume and perimeter constraints, and the lattice gas has seven discrete velocities.

659,Why is Retinoblastoma rare in adults? (Neurobiology // Pathology),"Hey biology friends,

Im currently in undergrad studying for a neurobiology exam coming up this Monday and the topic of Retinoblastoma came up. From what I understand, retinoblastoma is a pediatric cancer/tumor that develops in the retina (more specifically the cone cells) due to mutations to the tumor suppressing retinoblastoma gene. I'm a little unsure as to why it's more prevalent in children and less common and adults. I'd like to explain my thought process so that someone could tell me if I'm on the right track or not:

My thought process leads me to suggest that retinoblastoma is an inherited genetic mutation or a random DNA mutation that **almost always occurs during embryonic development** rather than random cancer causing cell mutations that occur in adulthood. This would cause retinoblastoma to be more common in children because the tumor suppressor protein would practically be hardwired to fail in regulating retina cell growth from day 1.

675,CRHR1 mutation,"This Study: https://www.psypost.org/2017/02/researchers-discover-brain-turns-chronic-stress-pathological-anxiety-47544

Says: '' The researchers studied rats that were genetically selected for higher alcohol drinking and also display an anxiety-like phenotype. **These rats exhibit a mutation in a gene called Crhr1 that increases CRF (type 1) receptor signaling.** ''

I uploaded my gene genotype to a site and it turns out I also have a mutation in CRHR1 which I assume is the same as the rats. My CRH and CRHR2 was fine.

The study also goes on to say: ''Using behavioral, neurochemical and electrophysiological approaches, **the researchers found that increased CRF signaling led to elevated activity of the anandamide clearance enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Increased CRF was also associated with drops in anandamide levels in the central nucleus of the amygdala.** Together, increased FAAH activity and decreased anandamide signaling reduce inhibitory control of excitatory neurotransmission in this critical region, and lower the brain’s ability to regulate stress and anxiety.''

So if you have a mutation in CRHR1 that means you get increased CRH signaling right to it? The study says that it lead to decreased anandamide in the amygdala, is  that where the CRH-CRHR1 signal targets? Or like where does the increased CRH-CRHR1 signaling happen? everywhere? in the PVN?

Assuming we have 2 encodings for a protein on a chromosome pair, one encode for variation ""X"" and one for variation ""x"" whereby ""X"" is dominant. What does that actually mean at a molecular level ?

Does it mean we produce half of the protein as X and half as x, but the way we observe the effects of X essentially allow us to say that it's dominant (e.g. both X and x form hair, but X also contains a thing which pigments the hair blue, and even if only 10% of the proteins are X the color still seems to us almost as stringent) ? Or are there situations where only X will be produced ? Or situations where X will result in product being much faster and thus almost all x disapearing ?

701,Biologist Breaking Away From The Lab,"Hey r / biology,

I have seen all the amazing feedback that other redditors have gotten from this sub and was hoping that some of you could do the same for me. I have learned so much from browsing here over the past couple months and think its great that people can come together like this to help strangers achieve something as important and crucial as understanding their career. Anyways, some background and context (and a wall of text) - I graduated this past May with a B.S. in Biology and had the luck to have spent most of my college career employed by an academic research lab studying insect genetics and evolution. I really enjoyed my time as a part of this team and have no regrets - I got to have dinner with crazy scientists, learned a lot of things my classes would never have taught me and was basically paid to listen to podcasts. However, I eventually realized that I found the day-day of lab-work tedious and unfulfilling, and I needed change - so I left and took the first job I was offered (bills had to be paid + having a partner who enjoys going out too much) at an upscale inn nearby. At first I found it awful, probably due to being rather introverted and having to relentlessly deal with so many strangers on a constant basis, as well as being part of such a large team, but after a few weeks I grew to really enjoy and succeed at my duties. The place has insane employee churn (most people last 2 weeks + endless supply of desperate college students willing to take whatever like I did) and after about 5 months I found myself being one of the longest employed individuals in the place. I was basically treated as a supervisor by everyone else, including the owner, who kept giving me more and more unofficial responsibilities. When this started happening I was worried that I wouldn't be able to handle it, but the opposite ended up being true - I found that I'm actually decent at training and supervising others. Everyone I have trained has stayed and is doing extremely well, which came as a surprise to me because I didn't even notice until the owner pointed out how I was able to clearly explain procedures and hypothetical scenarios, let people solve problems without immediately intruding, praising what they did right over what they did wrong and coming to their defense whenever a customer even slightly raised their voice. This all happened right around graduation when I was looking for jobs and I never really considered any of the above seriously. I applied only to research jobs because for so long that was what I thought I wanted, had studied and knew how to present myself as being geared to. I managed to get an interview offer and proceeded with the process for over two months and 6 rounds of interviewing over this past summer. The last interview consisted of meeting the 5 highest ranking members of the company in an interview room and answering any questions they had. Like most startups (from my understanding) they asked quite a lot of curve-ball, hippy dippy questions about people I looked up-to, philosophies I ascribed to, authors I read, and what science meant to me - all of which I answered fully, and to my belief, accurate in what they wanted to hear: My parents &amp; enthusiastic 4th grade science teacher who loved minerals, Taoism, Margaret Atwood &amp; Haruki Murakami, and that to understand science is to understand myself and a way to improve the human condition. One of the last questions was what appealed to me most about the job position, and like an idiot I didn't respond with the automatic answer I should have, but actually felt the need to think about it for awhile and then respond with a half assed response that I instantly knew was not convincing. I beat myself up for awhile about that moment, but in hindsight nothing really actually appealed to me, and it isn't what I wanted. I feel confident in what I want for myself now after college, and its not doing lab-work but I being a buffer in organizations between the decision makers (who may not understand the day-to day tasks of scientists) and the hardworking scientists themselves. I'm not a super talented scientist and I don't like working in a lab, but I love the things science illuminates and would be proud to find employment helping others in that goal. I learned about the position of being a project manager, and found a few open position as an assistant to life science company project managers and really want to get one of those jobs. Sorry for the wall of text, but to anyone who has read this far I would appreciate the help in shaping my [resume](https://docdro.id/gO9Af0K), which I feel seems pale in comparison to what I imagine it being.

712,I'm confused as heck...,"So I am currently thinking/planning on switching my major to something along the lines of ecology and biology. From my preliminary research I have found that it is quite a difficult field to have a stable career out of. I have also found that a lot of people have trouble finding ""success"" (depending on your definition of success). The only reason I ask is because I have been rethinking big life stuff and things, and kinda realized that the one common interest/passion that I have had in my life, is ""nature"" and ecology. But I did not go into that field when I began college, because I was worried about what I would do after. While going to school this year I kind of realized that, that just isn't right. I shouldn't forgo a passion out of fear for the future. I have decided That I don't want to pursue something that I will keep me financially stable (stupid right) but rather something I am truly passionate about. If you guise could give me some advice as to where I go from here or what things I should do to prepare for the long journey ahead. Or maybe provide some insight to your life and how you got to where you are today. If that is too much I would be grateful even some books, articles, movies, etc that might help aid me I would really appreciate it. I hope you have a beautiful day, take it easy.

I do not think the problem here is me not knowing the content, I feel like it is the way the professor words the questions. For example, I memorized the sodium potassium pump mechanism. She puts **the actual mechanism (SO WHY IN THE FUCK WOULD WE BE TOLD TO MEMORIZE THE MECHANISM)** on the exam and asks what would happen if the pump had K+ on the inside and Na+ on the outside (something like that it was extremely confusing). I just want to know what the reason is for asking such a weird question like that is. Is she trying to teach ""critical thinking skills""? I'm not degrading her in any way, she is a genius.

Thus I would like to know if there is a simple way to find out what the admissions rate for international applicants in graduate programs or their proportion within the cohort as many schools do not seem to publish this data (Stanford, MIT, JHU).

815,Looking to create a discussion on the relationship between gut bacteria and psychiatric medication.,"I don’t know where to post this so I think I’m going to try three different forums, and biology is one of them. I’ve become such a geek about physiology and I’m studying to become a physical therapist, but I don’t have friends that are interested in this kind of stuff so I’ve had this in the back of my head recently and I gotta get it out. I’m hoping for a *kind/civil* discussion. 

I don’t even know how to go about this so I’m going to make bullet points of the ideas I keep coming back to. I have a feeling that they’re all somehow related and I just want to know everyone else’s thoughts. 

-Healthy bacteria in your gut can go down in numbers when you eat unhealthy food. 

-Studies are showing that bacteria in your gut has an effect on your mood. 

-Bacteria in your gut wants to survive so if you eat certain foods that it’s not used to, it will try to send signals to the brain that say, “Hey, this is no good. We don’t have what it takes to digest this properly. Try to avoid it in the future.” (If I’m wrong on this could you send articles so I can check them out?)

-Psychiatric medications influence neurons/neurotransmitters in the brain. 

-Psychiatric medications affect appetite. 

-My big question, using ADHD medication as an example: Does the side effect of a suppressed appetite mean that the medication is potentially killing off healthy bacteria in your gut? 

-When people get off psychiatric meds, they experience not only swings in their mental cognition and emotions, they also experience digestion issues.

-If someone truly does have a neurological or emotional disorder, does that mean that in their true genetic state they have an imbalance in their gut bacteria? 

- Do you guys think in the future there will be a psychiatric shift from neurotransmitter control to gut Microbiome control? 

-Lastly, studies are starting to prove that neurological deterioration can be avoided or slightly reversed from ridding of inflammatory foods (among other things of course). So if someone who has to take a medication for long periods of time can only crave foods that are high in sugars and fats, will the long term effects of these medications affect how much more quickly their brain will deteriorate? 

Does any of this even make sense or am I just trying to make a connection out of nothing? Lol. I would love to hear your thoughts below. 

TL;DR: I think psychiatric medications are affecting healthy bacteria in your gut, and am wondering if there will be a future shift in psychiatry to control healthy digestion for increased cognitive functioning rather than regulating neurotransmitters with medication. Also, I am questioning if those who have to take psychiatric medications are more likely to develop neurological decline due to the inflammation properties in their gut that come as a result of the medication killing off good bacteria.

Theres this calcium binding protein on our skin. Psoriasin(s100a7). My teacher said its impossible to put e.coli on your hand for 2 hours, then take it and put it on a growth medium and let it grow because the psoriasin from the skin wont allow it to grow at all.

So i was curious if there are ways to do this because ""impossible"" is a pretty strong word.

I did some skimming through some papers. I couldnt find a paper that specifically talked about the issue im thinking of (if you know one i would be grateful beyond measure if you could link it to me). However i found some information nevertheless to atleast understand what questions i need to ask lol.

1) Is there a psoriasin resistant e.coli strain?

2) would having aids allow e.coli to grow under the conditions mentioned(does aids inhibit psoriasin production/activation?)

3) would using immunorepressive drugs allow e.coli to grow under the described condition( do immunorepressive drugs inhibit activation/production of psoriasin/calcium binding proteins in general?)

**Summary**

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function as master regulators of gene expression. Recent studies demonstrate that miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) play a unique role during cancer development. Here, we present QuagmiR, the first cloud-based tool to analyze isomiRs from next generation sequencing data. Using a novel and flexible searching algorithm designed for the detection and annotation of heterogeneous isomiRs, it permits extensive customization of the query process and reference databases to meet the user’s diverse research needs.

**Availability and implementation**

QuagmiR is written in Python and can be obtained freely from GitHub ([https://github.com/Gu-Lab-RBL-NCI/QuagmiR](https://github.com/Gu-Lab-RBL-NCI/QuagmiR)). QuagmiR can be run from the command line on local machines, as well as on high-performance servers. A web-accessible version of the tool has also been made available for use by academic researchers through the National Cancer Institute-funded Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud ([https://cancergenomicscloud.org](https://cancergenomicscloud.org/)).

1,"AKT1, weed, mental illness and cancer. How are they all linked?","I started researching into anxiety, mood disorders and other mental health issues as they seem to greatly affect my family. My brother (19) is currently unwell and seems to be experiencing depression possibly with some psychotic symptoms, or perhaps bipolar. We are currently trying to get him some help. My mother (50) has suffered from an anxiety disorder and other mental health issues all her life, possibly also bipolar or borderline personality disorder. I (23, f) am receiving treatment for what my therapist thinks is obsessional OCD and/or panic disorder. Bipolar disorder especially strongly runs in my family. 

I began wondering whether there was a link and came across AKT1 and I am going to pursue testing. I also discovered the link between AKT1 and psychotic like symptoms when smoking cannabis. My mum and brother are both quite anti drugs but I have had a plethora of experiences when smoking ranging from magical, divine thoughts to mild hallucinations alongside sometimes paranoid and terrifying thoughts and feelings of dread. I am now 90% sure that I have this gene and it is in my family.

However those with AKT1 also seem to have higher incidences of cancer. A study was done on mice and those with the AKT1 gene seemed to be cancer free. There is also constant controversy about the role of marijuana in curing cancer. AKT1 also occurs highly in those with schizophrenia, who are in turn more likely to develop certain types of cancer.

This all links together and I don't know how. I am a huge believer in weed legalisation and have seen how it is a wonder drug for others, I truly believe that it is a magical plant and so important. Could it be that weed acts as a warning drug, reacting in a certain way to those with the AKT1 gene to signify that they are at a higher risk of developing cancer, schizophrenia, bipolar or other illnesses? As if it's trying to say 'stop smoking me now, go get help, there's obviously something wrong with you because everyone else smoking is having a great time.'

32,What if we (re)introduced cheetahs to North America?,"I was watching a documentary about wolves in Yellowstone, and I had a crazy idea. 

What if we reintroduced Cheetahs to North America?

Maybe it's not really as crazy as it first appears. First, cheetahs wouldn't truly be an invasive species: they evolved in North America, only going extinct there about 12,000 years ago. Imagine if we had a north america where wolves went extinct 12,000 years ago. As we learned from Yellowstone, apex predators have an enormous and healthy balancing effect on their ecosystems. People would freak about about introducing wolves, but this is their natural habitat, and the ecosystem functions better with them. Why not cheetahs then too?

Pronghorn antelope are the fastest herbivores on the planet. They can run up to 55 miles per hour. There are currently no predators in North America that can come remotely close to this speed! They evolved to run this fast to escape from north american cheetahs, which no longer exist.  

Reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone helped its ecosystem return to a healthier, more natural state. They influenced the behavior of deer and elk in a way that helped the plants grow, reshaped riverbeds, led to more hawks and other birds (more bugs from the more diverse plant life), and even led to beavers returning to the area. Restoring another apex predator, the cheetah, to its natural place would likely have similar effects on other ecosystems in north america.

EDIT: could species translocations possibly help endangered animals (like the cheetah) struggling in their home environments? We already do this, in a sense, by housing endangered animals in special zoos with the goal of reintroducing them if conservation efforts fail.",biology,1494091800,gimli_rapes_cats,48,45,True,2017-05-06

37,Need help identifying a forest animal shout,"My parents used to have a campsite frame with a stationary caravan a few kilometers from our hometown. I basically grew up there and knew the whole area quite good. Directly on the borders of the campsite there was a big forest. Like 500m across the forest there was a road that intersected the forest and was the main road to drive to the bakery in the morning to get some bread. On that crossing there was an old house that seemed to be like at least 100 years old and was still made of light stone bricks. It was pretty shrunken and nature took over. There was a myth that a witch would be living there among us kids. A few years later i was spending the weekend together with a close friend and while my parents slept inside me and my friend slept outside in my tent. Like always when you can in those days you try to stay awake as long as you possibly can cause it is somehow forbidden and no one can control it. We were listening to the radio which ran pretty quietly and had a digital clock. At around maybe 2am we suddenly heard a noise coming from... i don't know where. We assumed it was coming from somewhere in the forest. I cant desribe it with words it was like a scream from an animal mixed with the sound of a crow i dont know. I only know that it was extremely loud and incredibly disturbing. The noise occured 3 times in a row then dead silence. It might be my imagination but it sounded like the animal? was killed after the 3rd noise. We both were completely anxious about it.
It was about half an hour or a full hour later when we heard something again. but this time very near to our tent. Our frame was at a T crossing and on one of the other frames there was a flagpole about 10m airline from our tent. maybe 15 at most. Metal was hitting metal several times and in the same frequency for about a minute. dead silence again. Nothing else happened the rest of the night but the other day we checked that flagpole and it actually didnt have a rope or metal loops to hold the flag. and the whole night was windless so SOMEONE had to be hitting that flagpole that night. I really would describe that night as traumatic.


I really need clarification if it was an animal or... something else.

If i really had to describe it i would say it was a roar starting low and ending high like uuuah within a second or so. My friend thought it would be a rutting call of a deer or something. But as i looked it up on youtube it wasnt any close to that. 

If you could help me identify what it was or could have been that would be very helpful with getting that story off my mind or at least defusing it.

I was born and raised in an underdeveloped country. As it happens with everything related to our government, the national education system is but a farce and the few of us who want to learn something must find ways to do it *despite* our schools.

Although I have finished high school, my knowledge in most areas is lacking, to say the very least. When it come to biology, I have retained some random pieces of information, which, put together, are far from composing a comprehensive whole, a system. I am, basically, illiterate.

Since I expect to have more free time in the near future, I decided to take care of my education. I cannot hire tutors, I cannot learn by watching (or listening) to courses, therefore I will have to study with books.

And here I am. I want to ask you, what are the best book (or books, or, preferably, series or collection of them) I can use to learn biology from the scratch to a relatively advanced level of proficiency?

I do not need to delve too into the deeper, esoteric levels of the discipline—I do not intend to get a Ph.D. in biology any time soon—but I want to be knowledgeable enough to be capable of going through a demanding engineering course whose curriculum biology integrates, for example.

I know that learning from books might not be optimal, but I really have no other option, and I have no trouble in making connections, in learning by myself from a source that does not present many lacunae—my English, for instance, is self-taught.

Be that as it may, the project must be self-contained—living in the farm, without electricity, I will not be able to access the Internet to read articles, and this is also the reason for my not resorting to audiovisual content.

Can you please advise me? Also, if you can suggest some extra reading besides the core content (meta-content, books that might assist the learning process itself, such as Barbara Oakley's *A Mind for Numbers* for math), pray do.

Thank you very much.

P.S.: For mathematics, which I also intend to study, I already have here *Mathematics: Its Content, Methods, and Meaning*, by Kolmogorov, Lavrent'ev and Aleksandrov, published by the M.I.T. press, but although I think it will be a valuable resource in the future, I believe it would not be a good starting point.

P.P.S. I have looked into posts about independent learning, but most of the replies assume access to the Internet or, at the very least, electricity, while I will have to make do without them (and consequently without the free online resources, such as Khan academy)—hence my posting this.

I realized that if I simply changed my major to general biology I'd be able finish on time easily AND take intro to computer programming (which I know nothing about) AND take biostatistics AND take a lab on molecular biology methods. Plus I will get to take ecology, which is not a requirement in my major currently. I wouldn't get to take any of those with the cell/molecular major, but I would take advanced cell biology, advanced genetics, and biochemistry, all of which I wouldn't take with the general major. 

On top of this I had an internship as a field and lab tech for an academic ecology project one summer/fall focusing on insects, and and will graduate with independent research in neuro-genetics. This adds another dimension (especially as a back-up to going right into grad school), as I feel like my internship will be useless with the molecular degree applying to more lab-based jobs, and the degree itself would be useless if I tried to swing my internship in applying to more environmental/field-based jobs (and call into question my interest in the job possibly). Also, I wonder if the lack of upper level genetics and cell biology or biochemistry will hurt me in applying to grad school.

On top of on top of this, my peers and reddit have convinced me that it is impossible to be successful (as in get a full-time job in my field to pay off student loans) with just a general biology degree, and I'd hate to fuck up right before the finish line, dooming myself to bio mediocrity.

I'm a third year biochem undergrad at UCSB. I'm having kind of a crisis about my future.

I think ecology or marine science would be something I really enjoy, but it's too late for me to switch majors. I've been volunteering in a marine science lab for a year.

A concern I have, however, is my grades. I got a couple of C's in ochem and a C in one of my Biochem courses. This makes me feel like I'm not adequate enough to get into any programs. My GPA right now is 2.99. I'm gonna work hard to bring it up but it seems a little daunting with 2 quarters of pchem ahead. 

I know when people have low GPAs they say research experience will go a long way. I can get a rec letter from the PI in my current lab but I feel like it won't have a large impact because I'm not really conducting experiments.. or doing actual science.

Does this mean that for every fatty acid we are only producing one Malonyl-CoA, to which we had multiple Acetyl groups until we get Palmitic Acid?

And would this be why the first step is the rate limiting step? Because once we produce one Malonyl-CoA then Fatty Acid Synthase starts eating up Acetyl-CoA to make Palmitic Acid?

My school recommended me to apply for a fisheries observer position up in Alaska. At first, it sounded great - about $4,000 a month, a life experience, plus training in a field relevant to my degree. I'm not against up ending my life and working long hours. But there are some things I am uncomfortable about. The job requires around 50 days off, so I'm going to spend about $2,000 on plane tickets just to go back home and lounge about. And because of these days off, the pay doesn't break $40,000. Secondly, the work shifts have no weekend breaks and 12 hour shifts. I knew the work was demanding, but for that kind of pay, I could make about the same working two full-time jobs, but still have all the luxuries of being home.

Perhaps the biggest thing that would make me decide is if the experience on my resume would be any use, especially if there is only one year of work. Does anyone have experience with this kind of job, and know that the skills learned would be generally useful in other fields?

95,"Antibodies against mRNA? - question about mRNA therapies/""cancer vaccines""","I've only JUST learned about mRNA-based therapies, particularly in the field of immuno-oncology.  However, I have very little understanding of how the immune system works.  

I understand that certain immune cells recognize proteins as ""non-self"" through some mechanism.  Non-self proteins stimulate production of antibodies against them in immune cells.  Cells then ""learn"" to continue making those antibodies and thus your immunity is broadened.

I understand that vaccines utilize a combo of ""dead"" viruses (non-self proteins) and ""adjuvants"" (to help stimulate the immune system somehow?) to help your immune system ""learn"" to make antibodies before a viral infection takes hold.

Now: I'm reading an article about how delivered mRNAs can be used to stimulate the immune system to make antibodies, similar to a vaccine.  However, I always thought that immune cells respond to ""non-self"" proteins and not necessarily mRNAs?  If said mRNA is taken up into cells, which then produce the protein, would that protein be recognized as ""self"" (it was made in the body's own cells) or ""non-self?""

Lastly, how/why would the immune system generate antibodies against something encoding an endogenous protein?  Cancer cells and immune cells interact and get along well enough for tumors to develop, how would a vaccine alone make immune cells start attacking the cancer?  More broadly: how would cancer vaccines work?

Okay, so when I'm sitting back and relax my eyes, I see Red, Blue, or Purple.  This is normal.  Sometimes it is just clear.  Okay so those are cells and dust particles known as floaters.

For reasons of environmental necessity, the line adopted the predatory way. For reasons of predatory necessity the line advanced. We learned to stand erect in the first place as a necessity of the hunting life. We learned to run in our pursuit of game across the yellowing African savannah. Our hands free from the mauling and the hauling, we had no further use for a snout; and so it retreated. And lacking fighting teeth or claws, we took recourse by necessity to the weapon. A rock, a stick, a heavy bone – to our ancestral killer ape it meant the margin of survival. But the use of the weapon meant new and multiplying demands on the nervous system for the coordination of muscle and touch and site. And so at last came the enlarged brain; so at last came man.""

- ""Far from the truth lay the antique assumption that man had fathered the weapon. The weapon, instead, had fathered man. The mightiest of predators had come about as the logical conclusion to an evolutionary transition. With his big brain and his stone and handaxes, man annihilated a predecessor who fought only with bones. And if all human history from that date has turned on the development of superior weapons, then it is for very sound reason. It is for genetic necessity. We design and compete with our weapons as birds build distinctive nests.""

142,"Do you hate pipetting? Tired of dodging the four-eyes, white coats, and gel jocks? Fresh out of school and want to work in the FIELD? Have an ADVENTURE or three? I may be able to help.","Links at the bottom, I'll answer questions about my experiences observing if you have any!

So, I have posted in some other threads that lament the dire job situation in the biological sciences- people ask what should I do after school, is my GPA high enough, did I do enough internships?  We all know the problems- publish or perish, limited positions, tons of competition, etc. ad nauseum.  I tell people I have a decent-paying, entry-level field biology job that requires no experience, provides a huge variety of field experience, and looks great on a resume.  It seems too good to be true from what we all seem to see on a daily basis with regard to entry-level job-searching in biology.  So I thought I would take a minute to explain to a little wider audience about yet another option for paying the bills using SCIENCE!

I am a fisheries observer- a private contractor working for the federal government (I am US-based) alongside commercial fishermen, gathering the myriad types of information and data that resource managers and industry personnel use to regulate their respective natural resources.  I have worked for 2 different contractors, in 3 different regions of the United States, in several different fisheries, for almost 5 years.  I got my job about a year after leaving school and working several minimum-wage gigs.

I am currently working under the North Pacific Observer Program, which is an entity of the National Marine Fisheries Service, underneath NOAA in the Dept. of Commerce.  I just returned from a 90-day deployment in Alaska and am home after a few weeks in Seattle, WA, going through the debriefing process dealing with all the data I collected while in the field.

A typical deployment in Alaska will have you assigned from 1-4 commercial fishing vessels, often alone, sometimes with a partner, working in several different fisheries (Walleye Pollock, Pacific Cod, Yellowfin Sole, Rockfish, Sablefish, etc.) on boats of varying sizes (90-350+ feet long), with different crews (3-130+), using different gear types (pelagic trawl, benthic trawl, longline, pot, jig, etc.).  You work with the fishermen, using standardized random sampling techniques to collect population biology data on each haul of their catch, including species identification, catch effort, catch weights, age structures, sex-length frequencies, and many other biological specimen data.  You collect data on seabirds, marine mammals, and often special research projects as assigned on your deployments.  You are solely responsible for the accuracy and quality of this data and often have little support while in the field, so self-motivation and discipline are important.  Working conditions can be wild.  I’ve been on deck sampling with 30+ foot waves crashing over the bow on me with 50+ knot winds blowing icing spray all over the boat. I’ve had my rain gear freeze solid, icicle boogers attached so solidly to my beard that I had to pour hot water on my face to keep from having to tear my beard hairs out to remove them.  I’ve had to use baseball bats to knock huge chunks of ice off the boat to keep from capsizing and tolerate hundreds of birds pooing all over me so that my bright orange life jacket turns white.  You’re expected to work in bad weather, you’re expected to work if you’re seasick.  Obviously, if you feel you’re in danger, your safety is your number one priority and takes precedent over other job duties, but the conditions are adverse and you are there to work and you are expected to do a good job.  There is a very low tolerance for shoddy work because the data you collect is managed real-time in most fisheries and it has to be uploaded by satellite at least daily.  Diligence or carelessness on the part of a single observer can be the difference between a smoothly running fishing fleet or boats having to stop fishing to have emergency industry meetings to sort out huge problems.  It’s a multi-billion dollar business that hinges upon the work that I and my colleagues do every day at sea.

However, its not all stoic, super serious work- you get to see things up close that other people pay thousands of dollars to get a shot at looking at through binoculars- tons of seabirds, marine mammals, wild and crazy rare fishes, beautiful landscapes, and cool towns.  Every day is an adventure.  I’ve collected some out-of-range species, seen some big sharks, weird deepwater species, etc.  I’ve seen summer wildflower blooms on remote islands, flown on tiny charter airplanes to get on boats, hung out with a few Deadliest Catch guys, seen the northern lights, and lots of other cool stuff.

You work and live aboard these vessels with the crew, eating, sleeping, and socializing with them, often without seeing land for long stretches (some longline vessels can fish for 50+ days without coming to port).  While you have no law enforcement authority, you are required to report potential violations or other problems with the crews.  This can sometimes create animosity or a sense of isolation from the fishermen and so conflict resolution skills and social awareness are important to being able to navigate the professional relationships you’re required to have while in close personal contact with the crews.  I’ve never had any serious problems with crews and usually most issues are solved quickly while onboard, but problems do happen. 
 
Living conditions on boats vary in quality, generally related to the size of the boat you are on.  On smaller boats, you will often share a stateroom with one or more other people, sometimes your partner, sometimes fishermen, or even a combination.  Larger boats often have large staterooms which you may have to yourself or only share with a partner.  Some even have private bathrooms, adjacent offices, exercise rooms, or other amenities.  Crews on small boats are often more like a family and usually know each other well, which creates a more cozy vibe, compared to the larger, more business-like large boats. Even the big boats are still small, compact, and efficient with space, so you have to be as well- I take my sampling gear, one large duffel with all my clothes, cold weather gear, and other equipment, plus one medium backpack where I keep my electronics, sensitive data materials, and other personal effects.  Everything I need for 3 months.  You are expected to live small, and be ready to move fast and often.  Sometimes, you have less than 4 hours of notice before you are expected to have all your belongings packed, organized and moved to another boat or fly somewhere.  Efficiency is important.  There is usually plenty of goof-off time, and I personally fill it with several console emulators on my laptop, PC games, a Kindle, Ipod, and a couple of hard drives filled with movies and tv shows, in addition to hanging out and overeating snack food in the galley, or watching movies with the crew.  Internet on the boats is becoming more normal, but its basically back to dial-up days- no streaming, no music, email works ok, facebook is iffy, and while browsing reddit is usually fine, you can forget your favorite HD pic, gif, or other bandwidth-heavy subs- stick to the text-heavy ones like /r/defaultgems and /r/bestof (just remember to do your job first, lol).  Food is also variable, from homecooked meals every day on smaller boats (I get involved in cooking when I have time), to full-service cafeterias with professional kitchen staffs on large boats and everything in between (there is certainly bad food too- living on cereal for a few weeks is not fun).  Many boats sort of revolve around the galley, since it’s the only place where the crew can unwind, socialize, and enjoy a comforting meal.  Boat crews know this and at least spend a good amount of money on food, so even if the cook thinks well-done steaks are just fine, there is always plenty of food to go around.

The port towns range from strange, sparsely populated, otherworldly Aleutian islands with sprawling abandoned military bases (Adak Island) to thriving fishing communities (Dutch Harbor and Kodiak Island) to large seaport metropolitan cities (Seattle, Tacoma, Anchorage).  Its always fun to go exploring during your town time.  There is a wide variety of activities ranging from outdoorsy stuff (fishing, hiking, exploring, etc) to nightlife and even travel.  I like to buy a fishing license and go salmon fishing in the summer time, bonfires on the beach, exploring old grounded shipwrecks, WWII relics (fortifications, abandoned equipment, etc.).

As far as NMFS and your contractors employers go, you don’t deal much with them in person except when you do the initial 3-week job training course, brief and debrief at the beginning and end of each deployment.  Briefings are 1-4 days long and are designed to update you on regulatory changes, new sampling protocols, species ID refreshers, etc. before your next deployment.  They are typically in a laid back lecture/lab classroom format and while they are taken seriously and meant to convey important info, they are not necessarily challenging for its own sake. Debriefings are after each deployment where you are expected to organize, proofread, and prepare your data to essentially defend it to a NMFS employed professional before all are again re-checked, catalogued, and archived.  They are in depth, detailed, and you are expected to be able to explain your data, any problems that may have arisen, write statements regarding potential regulatory violations you witnessed, defending new species you’ve encountered, and help your debriefer prepare specimens (otoliths, scales, stomachs, genetics specimens, seabirds, marine mammal specimens, etc.).  This can take several full days discussing your work with your debriefer, especially if you return with hundreds of pages of raw data and paperwork (300+ pages is not infrequent).  These folks are your support staff while in the field and you have opportunities to contact them regarding problems, questions, advice, or other issues throughout your deployment.  They are your advocates when problems arise with crews or boats, and take it very seriously- they have a lot of resources at their disposal to help you out, from simple emails or phone calls, all the way up to full-blown Coast Guard and Alaska State Trooper Special Response or Search and Rescue teams.  They have your back.

During your time in Seattle, you typically are put up by your company in hotels or rental properties and reimbursed for some living expenses.  Its simple and compartmentalized, so there is no need to pick up and move your life if you don’t want to- I spend my off time traveling the country/world or vegging out with various family members for as long as they’ll have me on their couch.  I know lots of people who do have their own houses or apartments, either in Seattle or elsewhere near and far, but most observers save money by not having an apartment to pay for.  Off times vary, but I typically take off 3-5 months a year for travel, holidays, etc.  Payscales vary between the companies, but field pay starts at about $150 per day and goes up to about $220 per day with more experience, with Seattle pay being around $100 per day, plus some reimbursable expenses.  If you work a lot, its possible to pull down about 40-50k per year before taxes.  Not having many living expenses helps a lot too- while you’re on contract, you don’t have much you need to cover.  Other benefits also vary between companies, as far as health insurance, etc.  

Observing is not designed to be a career, but its an excellent way to gain valuable work experience, get some connections with federal agencies and industry personnel.  Alaska commercial fisheries are among the few well-managed fisheries in the world, so cutting your teeth in the Bering Sea has the potential to open a lot of future opportunities.  I’m not aware of many other entry-level positions that are better than this, as far as resume-building, pay, or just cool-factor.

The North Pacific Observer Program in Alaska is not the only one of its kind in the US- each region has one or more similar programs that hire observers on a regular basis to be on the frontlines of monitoring and managing the wide array of commercial fisheries.  I’ve worked in 3 regions- Alaska, West Coast, and Southeast.  I’ve focused on Alaska because its what I have the most experience with and I believe it’s the best choice for those fresh out of college looking for a job that is always hiring and doesn’t require you to move.  I can answer questions or give some guidance on other options if anyone asks, and I’m willing to answer most questions you may have about observing

143,"[Help] Which ""path"" in Biology would this be ?","Hi

**First of**
&amp;nbsp;


Thanks for anyone that takes the time to read and reply to this, I am a bit lost right now. I am going to choose that I want to study at university next year and I'm stuck in a weird place. I am considering either Biology (in the career ""described below"" or Civil engineering.


So I am a bit confused as to what the specific ""path"" or area of biology my career would be in. As in I don't know what it would be called and I am not sure what the REAL job / career would involve + unsure on how to get there. And so I am hoping someone here can help me to narrow it down to something more specific.

**[THE ""QUESTION"" IS HERE]**
&amp;nbsp;

I would like my career to take me down a path where I get to spend time outside, either managing an area (Example, a coral reef) or studying it / observing. I would not like to be inside a lab for the entire time, but that is not to say it can't be included in the job description. 

I have considered something like an environmental engineer and also a marine biologist, but I don't have any concrete information that just ""hooks"" me yet.

My big dream is properly to move to Japan and study / managing some of the life there. If this is far fetched or not I do not know, so if you could enlighten me or point me in the right direction here too, that would be awesome.

**Addition:** Would my described career perhaps be similar to a *Wildlife biologist* ? If so, how would one go about aiming for that career ?

165,Questions about applying to graduate schools and PHD programs,"**Student Background**

Hello, I'm a student at a state school in the midwest (USA).  I'll be graduating in a year with a degree in Environmental Science with a concentration in biology.  I was planning to apply for field biology positions, as well as lab positions and really anything I could get after graduating.  I've talked to several advisors and faculty members at my school and they think I have a good chance of getting a job after graduating because of the experience I have.

**Experience** 

I've assisted in a few research projects, and I have experience quantifying animal behavior from videos and also some experience identifying algae using microscopy.  I have experience with basic lab work, both chemical techniques like phosphorus analysis and ion chromatography and bio lab work like weighing/measuring/identifying plants.  I worked with another student on a 9 month project looking at land use, environmental variables (P, N concentrations and ratios), and algal blooms.  We presented that at our undergraduate symposium and we are hoping to publish a paper on our work. (not 100% sure if we will be able to, but we're trying).  

I'm spending the summer assisting an ecology professor.  I'll be doing some lab work but mainly learning R and trying to learn how to analyze previously collected ecological data sets, hopefully forming my own hypothesis after analyzing data and reading relevant literature.  Its an on going project.  I also have a part-time unpaid internship quantifying stream depth, vegetation cover, and other variables for a local non-profit watershed council.  I'll also gain a bit of experience doing education/outreach with school groups through that internship, and hopefully further my GIS skills. 

By the time I graduate, I will have hopefully presented again at our undergraduate symposium, presenting the work I'm doing this summer (which will continue into the fall and perhaps longer) with the ecology professor I mentioned.  There is a good chance I'll have experience doing snake surveys by then as well.  

I need one more research credit or internship to graduate as well, and I'll hopefully be interning at a consulting agency or government agency. (I'm not 100% sure what exactly I want to do with my life, so hopefully I can contrast non-profit work with government or private sector work to give myself some direction).

I feel like I have a good amount of experience and strong references and I think I have a good chance of getting a job after I graduate. 

**Why I'm writing this post** 

However, I was talking to a few professors recently, and I've been strongly encouraged to apply for graduate school and phd programs, and I've started to consider going straight into a program instead of working for a few years first (my previous plan) 

I'm writing this extremely long post today to try and figure out how strong of a candidate I'd be for grad school or a phd program.  I have a meeting with an advisor in a week, but I figure it can't hurt to get as many perspectives as possible.

**Important Info**

I'd want a higher degree in ecology, environmental science, or conservation biology

I'm interested in things like using biology/ecology to understand environmental threats to human populations and using biology/ecology to understand effects of climate change and other human-related issues on natural and human systems.  I'm interested in urban environments, or environments that have been modified by humans.  I'm really interested in a concept I came across called reconciliation ecology, don't know how realistic it is to study that.  

My school is not well known and isn't prestigious or hard to get into.  However, the bio department is one of the largest, and considered one of the better programs at our school.  Our environmental science program is young but is science based and is a B.S., I take mostly science classes.  A plurality of my credits are biology.

My GPA upon graduation will be 3.40-3.50.  My grades were worst as a freshman, and have gotten better every year.  Got a 3.83 and 3.97 the two most recent semesters.  My major GPA is higher than my overall GPA. 

I will be able to get at least three strong recommendation letters from professors and (internship) supervisors I've worked with closely.  

Like I mentioned above, I have a lot of research experience and will have done two internships (one field work, one TBD) upon graduation.  Will have possibly published a research paper.  

**One last piece of really important info**

I'm from a big-ish city (40-70th biggest in the USA) and went to college in a small town.  I really want to get back to a bigger city, and the dream is to move to New York City to join some family that has moved there.  If not NYC, I'd really like to move to a larger city in the USA or abroad, if that is a possibility.  I know everyone wants to live in places like these, making schools more competitive, but that is what I really want to do if possible.  

**How strong of a candidate am I for a Masters Program or PhD program in a larger city in the USA or another English speaking country?**

Also, might as well ask, how strong of a candidate am I for jobs upon graduating?  What kind of jobs come to mind? (I know this is kind of a generic question?

Any suggestions for programs/schools I should look into?

Anyone who read all the way through this and tried to answer some of my questions, THANK YOU so much! I'm trying to figure out my future and hearing from other people in related fields offers me great perspective.

Hey guys! So I figured I'd share a pretty sweet update since I last posted. As it is, I've just accepted a lab position with a pharmaceutical company, and I couldn't be more excited. To be honest, hearing the feedback from my original post gave me some extra motivation to keep at it with resume posting and job hunting, but it wasn't until I spoke with someone in the industry that I realized that I was selling myself short on my resume.

When I was listing my laboratory skills, I would essentially just list whichever skill I felt I had enough experience with (gas chromatography, RT-PCR, Flow Cytometry, etc.). From what I learned from someone that has been in the industry for 20+ years, laboratory managers want to know about how these specific skills were implemented in a laboratory setting, so I reworded my laboratory skills section. Instead of simply putting RT-PCR as a skill, I would change it to ""Performed RT-PCR to determine levels of TNF-α in the presence of LPS"" and so on.

And I think it also goes without saying that if you're feeling discouraged about your GPA, DO NOT GIVE UP! All it takes is that one yes to forget about all of the no's, and something will happen for you if you continue to pursue each and every opportunity you can. 

If you hang around the barber shop long enough, you're eventually gonna get a haircut.

182,Why it is so hard to ask my PI to buy reagents...,"Hey guys! I'm a PhD student in a lab of 6 people. I don't think we have funding problem, with one R01 and a couple of other small grants. But I just find it is very hard to ask my PI to buy reagents. 

Sometimes I read a paper or attend a seminar, and get inspired with some ideas. I want to see if that works in my system, so I go to my PI asking if I can buy the reagent and try. He will say ""It is a very good idea, let me think about it."". I'm very excited about the idea and ask my PI again about the reagent later, but will still get ""let me think about it"". Later, a postdoc who has been working in the lab for many many years says that when my PI saying ""let me think about it"", it is a NO.

I think lots of great work come from trying different ideas. Especially as a graduate student just entering lab, we don't usually directly come up with some good hypotheses which proved to be working later. We just keep trying different directions, and maybe one out of ten works then we have a paper. 

I really think reagent is one of the issues that block my research progress. I want to work hard and do the experiment to test my ideas, but without any promising results first my PI won't agree to buy the reagent. 

I'm just so tired of spending time arguing back and forth with my PI on the reagent thing. Anyone has the same problem with me? Any suggestions? Thanks!

Is the itchyness a byproduct of the virus or has it evolved to induce scratching? 

Does a rash making virus target PNS neurotransmitters to induce constant itching or does the virus just attack every cell in the skin and that's why it itches?

When you scratch that area, is any dopamine released? Is it because dopamine is naturally released when we soothe pain? Because it feels incredibly good to scratch, and a little addictive.

Finally, do rash viruses somehow stimulate monoamine neurotransmiter activity when the skin is broken to encourage more breaking of the skin? I'm thinking maybe it codes into a PNS nerve cell the proper DNA to send an influx to the spine similar to one of a sexual organ being stimulated. If that's even how things work.

I’ve seen a lot of opinions about the correlation between telomere length and lifestyle choices, some scientists support the existence of this interrelation, some don’t trust the proof. I’m more of a believer so would love to study it more and contribute to promoting a healthy lifestyle. 

What do you think about this? Do you believe that telomere length and lifestyle are truly connected? Would you recommend that I take the lifestyle path in telomeric study?

I have had more than 2+ years of experience in recombinant DNA techniques and standard molecular biology techniques while I was an undergraduate in a human genetics lab. I also performed sequencing analysis (after cloning an exon using PCR) and have used BLAST in a bioinformatics course.

299,M.E. in Bioengineering or Clinical Laboratory Scientist Licensure (or both)?,"Hi everyone,

I'm finishing my baccalaureate degree this month, and have two wonderful opportunities in the research field that I cannot decide between. My fiance and I will be moving to a new city where I am able to pursue a M. Eng. degree for bioengineering and where he was offered a prestigious engineering job. That being said, upon completing the masters program, there are very few biotechnology companies in this particular city, and I'm concerned about securing a good research position in the city (most of the current job listings I have found are for entry-level, laboratory technician positions). That being said, I'm considering potentially pursuing a Clinical Laboratory Scientist license following the masters program, as there is an abundance of hospitals in the city looking to fill CLS roles. According to many of my friends and family members whom I've sought advice from, doing both won't necessarily give me a leg up for either the private biotechnology industry or the clinical research field, and one may prove to be an unnecessary, additional cost. For me, I think the CLS = job security, while the M.Eng. = job mobility (in the sense that I will be able to climb the ladder, should I get a position at one of the few, small contract research organizations in this city, or we move to a different city with many more biotech companies/opportunities). And if I were to do both and manage the costs financially, I at least can have the option between the two career routes at any given time. What would you do in this position? Is it worth investing in both credentials?


tl;dr: I want to pursue an M.Eng. degree in bioengineering for job mobility and a CLS license for job security, even though they aren't directly benefiting me for the same profession/career path. Is it worth investing in both? Is one worth investing more in?

301,Why can't we make a human from ips cells?,"Let me play devils advocate here (pun intended). The creationist folks, a bit like flat earthers, are always looking for proof of their beliefs.

Take the egg cell. Able to become a human, it gets punctured by a sperm and becomes a true human cell, and it divides and divides perfectly into a new baby. An embryonic stem cell, or ips cell, on the other hand, can be put in a dish and it will kind of give a half assed effort to turn into a blastocyst, but it won't work. In the end, it will just grow into a meatball of stem cells.

What changed? How come, if you were to take 16 ips cells, all resulting from the division of one, and magically glue them together with membrane proteins, and then stick the whole kit and caboodle into an empty zona, it would never become a person?

But on the other hand, just take one fertilized egg cell and watch it divide into 16 morula cells, and you can be sure that in 9 months, your gonna be changing diapers.

Why is this? They're all ips cells aren't they?

This seems like an argument a creationist could make towards the presence of some soul that is created when an egg is fertilized, that can only ever exist in these circumstances, created only by god at the moment of fertilization, and no matter how hard you try to create one, without that ""soul"", it just won't work, because souls can only be created by god and not people.

430,A Human Can Beat a Fully Grown Male Silverback Gorilla Without Weapons,"Humans are severely underestimated in terms of how powerful we are unarmed. We may not have fur to protect against scratches and bites or claws to slash our enemies, but we are still big powerful apes. 

One of the most common myths about Gorillas is that they are several times stronger than humans. This is false. No strength tests have ever been done on gorillas. Some people say that gorillas are stronger than chimps and chimps are 4-6 times stronger than humans, therefore gorillas are much stronger than humans. This is also false, Chimpanzees are not 4 to 6 times stronger than humans. The study which lead people to believe that chimps possess superhuman strength was proven wrong in 1943 and again in the 1960s. There is a difference between pound for pound and absolute strength. A chimp's absolute **pulling** strength is equal to a human's absolute pulling strength. However, the pushing strength of a human is probably much stronger than the pushing strength of any other primate due to our lifestyles. 

So, gorillas are probably stronger than humans at pulling but weaker than humans at pushing. 

Because of this and the Gorillas anatomy, Gorillas (and other primates except for humans) are incapable of hitting hard. Gorillas and other primates mainly fight by pulling and biting, whereas humans have literally evolved to punch. The human fist has evolved for bludgeoning. In fact, the human fist is an extremely underrated weapon. [Trained fighters can hit with over a thousand pounds of force](https://www.connectsavannah.com/savannah/the-true-force-of-a-boxers-punch/Content?oid=2133328) 

Our punches are strong enough to break slabs of concrete, [which require 675 lbs of force to break](http://boingboing.net/2010/09/03/the-physics-of-break.html) There is no doubt that a human punch can injure a gorilla. 

On top of that, humans have opposable thumbs. A problem when fighting a gorilla is the gorilla's enormous canines. A gorilla's bite force is estimated to be 1300 PSI. If the Gorilla does manage to bite your arm, it won't break instantly. The human bone can take a remarkable amount of punishment before breaking. But one must act quick because a gorillas bite would eventually snap the bones in a persons forearm. As soon as the gorilla bites the man's arm, the man must dig his opposable thumbs into the gorillas eyes, making it back off. 

Another big problem when fighting a gorilla, is the gorillas bodyweight. Most gorillas weigh around 350 lbs while the heaviest can weigh up to 480 lbs. Most of them are around 5 feet tall, they rarely reach 6 feet. In incredibly rare cases, gorillas can reach 6'6. When gorillas fight, they tend to thrust their bodyweight at each other. [A gorilla was able to crack the glass at a zoo enclosure by doing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTIIaWxvpCg)

So a man must never stand in the way of a charging gorilla when fighting one. One must quickly move back and around in circles to prevent getting charged at directly while throwing powerful blows at the same time. This would eventually tire out the gorilla, and one powerful blow could potentially put the gorilla to sleep. 

However, fighting a gorilla is not something that the average human can do. The human must be large and muscular, weighing at least 250+ lbs of lean muscle so that while he is moving back and around in circles he can use his pushing strength to resist the thrusting force of the gorilla (I am not talking about the full thrusting force. The man would be moving in circles so he might be exposed to some of the thrusting force but not all of it. No man [except for maybe Hathor Bjornsson or Brian Shaw who are in the same weight class as gorillas] is strong enough to stand directly in front of a gorilla and resist the full force of its bodyweight being thrusted forward). 

Conclusion: An incredibly athletic human weighing 250+ lbs can beat a fully grown gorilla in a fight without weapons

This may be a bit of a morbid question, but how does CO2 cause death so quickly?

I recently joined a lab that uses mouse models.  Today I needed to euthanise some for disection; which consisted of me placing them one at a time in a glass vessel and filling the vessel with CO2 from an attached tank until they died.  Now I was surprised at how fast the mice died, in as little as 15 seconds.  I would have thought that it would have been a slower process, I could hold my breath longer then it took them to die, and I always thought that people could survive fine with no air for 8ish minutes.  Is it just a difference in physiologies?

Also, as a side question, after seeing how fast the mice died I started holding my breath when opening the container to get the body because I was a bit afraid of getting exposed.  Is this a valid worry or am I being paranoid?",biology,1496360751,co2question,5,1,True,2017-06-01

My current knowledge is this: a stem-cell differentiates into a T-cell in the bone marrow, where the t-cell then leaves and matures in the thymus. It matures either into a naive helper t-cell, or naive cytotoxic t cell (for all intents and purposes if you are only looking at those two types of t cells). The lymphocyte then leaves the thymus and seeds the lymph nodes and humors. It floats around here until an APC (antigen presenting cell) binds to its specific receptor and activates it. If it is a naive helper t-cell, it gives rise to memory helper t cells and active helper t cells. It also secretes cytokines which allows for the activation of cytotoxic t cells. If it is a cytotoxic t cell, it is not active until it recieves the chemical message from a t cell to being destruction.

Is this correct? Or is it just one universal t-cell much like the b-cell that gives rise to all its sub-units?

I've been suggested to apply as a Research Coordinator in a hospital near me. I know a majority of us are biologists in fields where we either go out and get samples from wildlife, do assays, ligations, make buffers, etc. 

I've received my BS in Cell Biology from UC Davis in 2016. Despite tackling on a VERY research based major, I did not intend on pursuing a career in lab research. I actually am trying to pursue a Master's in Nursing and am currently applying for programs this fall. 

Anyways... Since I transferred from CC to UC Davis, I could have definitely gotten experience in research during the two years I was there. Unfortunately, I took part in health career related clubs, a support group for Type 1 Diabetes (see my post history as I am a T1D-ic), and volunteered/interned at the hospital. 

I have taken 2 lab classes at Davis for microbiology and for cell biology. I've learned how to culture bacteria, transfect yeast, do dilutions, spins, western blot, use ImageJ, and some fluorescent microscopy. I haven't touched these techniques in a year, but if anyone gave me a quick over view, I can perform them.

Before beginning the job, I knew absolutely nothing about Syngenta, so everything I learnt about the company was while on the job.

I'm very concerned about environment-related topics, such as climate change, beekeeping's population decline, GMO, and such, as well human rights.

I recently learnt that Syngenta was not that clean on these topics, as they are lobbying in the US, they hired a militia to bring to heel a land occupation in Brasil, and they produce pesticides and GMOs. 

Because of these, I'm considering to ask for a transfer in another service in my company, or even quitting. I know that finding a new job won't be very hard, as I regularly receive messages from employers wanting me to join them.

I’m thinking this time around I really want to follow my interests and do something I’m juiced about, rather than something more vocation focused (my Bachelors is in Social Science (Legal &amp; Dispute Studies)). 

I’m really interested in the natural world/evolution/animals and conservation/history/archaeology and anthropology and I love the idea of working outdoors and doing something of consequence. I love documentaries, traveling as much as I can, my favourite books are ‘My family and other animals’ by Gerald Durrel and ‘Homo Sapiens’ and ‘Homo Deus’ by Yuval Noah Harari. I also just finished ‘A Short History of Nearly Everything’ by Bill Bryson and loved it. The Melbourne Zoo is definitely one of my favourite places as well - I remember as a child, being a zookeeper was the first job I ever wanted. I just came back from Borneo where I had the chance to visit a few animal sanctuaries, go on wildlife tours and get my dive license as well, which was incredible.

I really want to commit the rest of my working life to a field that makes the world a better place - and at the moment I feel like the environment needs all the help it can get!

I enjoyed ecotoxicology but I fear its not the subject for me due to funding and salary issues.

The vastness of the biological sciences field is a little daunting and I feel unprepared for choosing what I want to do. Therefore, I want to know more about the many areas of biology that I haven't yet had a chance to explore. 

Firstly, I'd like to hear your thoughts about the most exciting areas of biology in terms of variety and opportunity. I often hear about post graduate projects where students are stuck doing endless comet assays etc, I would ideally like the opportunity to work in the lab and in the field as variety is the spice of life. As much as I want to save turtles in Hawaii, I don't want to sacrifice salary in doing so.

Secondly, I'm aware that research is a little tedious at the best of times but in your opinion, what are the least tedious techniques to aim for. I am assuming that certain areas of biology involve certain assays (e.g. genotoxicity and carcinogenicity involves lots of comet assays or counting chromosomes, micronuclei etc). So far I've mainly done qPCR, gel electrophoresis and biochemical/chromatography assays. 

Lastly, I've recently found myself interested in neuroscience and want to know more about this field. What are the most exciting areas of this field?

633,Help request to grow two plants.,"So, I am growing two species of coffee and one of them seems to be a calcifuge (Al, Aluminum tolerant, Fe, Iron inefficient) with preferable ph of 3.5 and the other seems to be a calcicole (Fe, Iron Efficient, Al, Aluminum sensitive) with preferable ph of 4.7, based on the minimal available scientific research.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
With this realization I've been looking for the best soils for both species and made a list, and from the opinions of other average users on the internet who claim they are soil characteristic students and hence seem to have more experience/technicality than the usual gardener as well as typical gardeners, they have made posts themselves (on other forums) in relation to identifying and discussing the best soils and which to use for growing these plants, so above everything, from the user which seemed to be the most experienced/technical, his most important mentionable post claims that the natural soils of these plants are very poor and they could be bettered with common soil conditioning approaches and describes their natural soils, he says the soils they are found in range from not immediately available quite increased iron specific volcanic substrates or fertile alluvial (sedimentary) soils to nutrient deficient eroded clays which are essentially dust, without this I didn't find any much research on the species, other less important considerations from other users about the soils conditionings of this soil variety list are, composted pine grits are a good way to make the soil a little more acid, clay (clay based soils) should be avoided because it tends to bring the substrates ph to alkaline (please verify/clarify this if you can), perlite is a good addition because it keeps the soil airy and retains moisture, which the plants need. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
One of my considerations beforehand: many of these plants on other users experiences seem to grow well on typical mixes of perlite/average potting soil/composts, but they never related which soil mixes they used, based on several researches/information’s from other users here's the list I gathered with some details for consideration on what is the best medium/composite to use and which I'm looking for opinions on which one would be the best to use relating to the previous characteristics about the plants.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
As I've mentioned, also added some other considerations I’ve found throughout for certain composites/materials on this list that could be important and if you have any other considerations to add please post/share them.
_______________________________________________________________________________________

&amp;nbsp;

1 -  Two parts of a standard commercial potting mix, one to two parts topsoil, and one part perlite. Mix some red volcanic rock as fertile, mineral rich soil that is well draining. It should not be to heavy so be careful with topsoil. Add more volcanic rock and/or perlite if the mixture is too dense (this is the recommended soil composure by the most experienced/technical user and many of the soils are based upon this).

&amp;nbsp;

2 - 25% of river or building sand (ph ≈ 7), thick and clean; 25% of fine perlite (ph ≈ 7); 25% steril marl/marlstone (ph ≈ 8.1); 25% sphagnum peat moss (ph 3.5-4.6)

&amp;nbsp;

3 - 25% coarse clean sand (ph ≈ 7); 25% perlite (ph ≈ 7); 25% sterilized loam (ph 5-7); 25% milled peat (ph 3.5-4.6) (peat is dangerous because it can form a peat bog and make the soil super acidic, it has bad non-sterile microorganisms, has no/lacks nutrients and its nonrenewable). If it seems too light, increase loam and peat (ph 3.5-4.6) (peat is dangerous because it can form a peat bog and make the soil super acidic, it has bad non-sterile microorganisms, has no/lacks nutrients and its nonrenewable). Some sterilized organic compost (no set ph), screened may also be added for nutrition.

&amp;nbsp;

4 - 35% potting soil (ph ≈ 7-8); 15% perlite (ph ≈ 7); 25% cured manure (no set ph); 25% charcoal (no set ph).

&amp;nbsp;

5 - 10% silt (ph ≈ 5-7); 20% humus/loam (ph 5-7) (""used up"" compost, full of humates and fulvates); 20% fresh compost (no set ph); 25% iron clay based soil (no set ph) (like from most yards or pine forests); 25% composted wood bits or sand/grit (ph ≈ 7-8) (grit which prevents the ph from decreasing drastically, see http://aquaponics.net.au/forum/threads/low-ph-using-shell-grit-to-counter-low-water-ph.6252/) This soil will feed okay for 6 weeks but after that, water fertilizer should be fed to the plant. Better used renewed from the top or repotted.

&amp;nbsp;

6 - **This post didn’t have the amounts,** (40%?) soil with worm casts (ph 6.8) (5-20% max of the soil mix composition and it lasts for 1-2 years, good at holding moisture, increasing soil structure and making soil fertile) (not advised since it releases toxic gases that damage the growth of the plants, unless they’re decomposed) or organic matter (no set ph) (not advised since it’s a medium rich in calcium and the plants do not like basic soils rich in calcium), a little bit each of (10%?) black rock phosphate (phosphorite) (no set ph), greensand (10%?) (ph 6.2-8.5) (removes iron and manganese, is this prejudicial?), fossilized seabird guano (10%?) (no set ph) and dry humate (10%?) (no set ph). The mix is lightened up with peat moss (10%?) (ph 3.5-4.6) (peat is dangerous because it can form a peat bog and make the soil super acidic, it has bad non-sterile microorganisms, has no/lacks nutrients and its nonrenewable) and perlite (10%). The plants are given rain water with a little clay and fulvic acid (no set ph) and mild organic hydro fertilizers (no set ph), on which quantity to mix this fertilizer?

&amp;nbsp;

7 – 20% coco coir (ph 6-6.7); 20% red akadama (ph 6.5-7.2) (clay available at bonsai); 20% kiriu/kiryu (ph 6.5-6.8) (river soil from bonsai supply); 20% kanuma (ph 4.5-5) (low ph clay); 10% perlite (ph ≈ 7). Order all in the small size for better root growth. The red akadama has many elements and so does the kanuma. all of the materials are volcanic type clay and are imported from japan and used in the bonsai industry. Very closely resembles the iron and low ph soil needed.

&amp;nbsp;

8 - 40% rich potting compost (ph ≈ 7-8); 40% peat (ph 3.5-4.6) (peat is dangerous because it can form a peat bog and make the soil super acidic, it has bad non-sterile microorganisms, has no/lacks nutrients and its nonrenewable) substitute (a slightly acid, lime-free compost); 20% perlite (ph ≈ 7).

&amp;nbsp;

9 - 70% coco coir (ph 6-6.7)/coco fiber preferable (ph 5.2-6.8); 30% perlite (ph ≈ 7).

648,"IF YOU UNDERSTAND EVOLUTION, THIS POST IS NECESSARY FOR YOU TO READ.","***READ THIS THREAD WITH AN OPEN MIND IF YOU ARE THINKING OF GIVING YOUR OPINION IN THE COMMENTS***

In the day and age we live in, we are perceiving the evolution of the machine day after day, an evolution we call technology. Now from a biologist's perspective, the direction technology is taking nowadays is very special and unique; It is the first time in the history of the earth that a species born from the classic mechanism of life (synthesis from DNA and related mechanisms) was able to create an ""organism"" capable of mimicking what we perceive as actions that generally only apply to living beings. As an example, let's think about an Amazon machine that finds and picks up boxes in the company's storage facility for devilry. It first receives the information about the item it needs to find and then picks it up from the row it is located at which it knows from memory.

Now of course, a machine like that had its memory programmed by a human who most likely inputted the item's row number on some kind of software that was shared with the machine in question. This means that, ultimately, the input of a human being was necessary for this machine to perform its task. 

Well! it seems that soon enough it won't be the case. We have started to program machines that are able to learn patterns and algorithmes, who excel at some tasks better and are more efficient than human beings. The same machine that was just moving the boxes from A to B will soon be able to manage the whole facility instead of just moving boxes. The machines, at this point in time, doesn't exhibit every characteristic of what we classify as a life form such as reproducing, but since they're not organic I believe there's no reason for them to have this characteristic to be considered alive. Being human, we want to put ourselves above all things, like as though we are superior to everything and invincible as a race, I mean can anyone of you even think about human extinction? 

Now how can a machine surpass a human in intelligence you may ask? Well, to put it simply, machines using pattern recognition to learn are much much more efficient at doing so than humans. They are faster at this task because they don't have to rely on the biological form of adaptative learning where you have to be exposed to a certain stimulus repetitively to learn, not to mention that the process is also partly governed by gene expression in living organisms. AI don't have a biochemical step to learning, meaning they are faster at memory forming.

Now, we all know how evolution works: the most adapted to their environment always survives. If we keep improving technology and AI (which I'm not actually discouraging), then we could eventually get surpassed by our own creations rendering us obsolete since a machine would be able to replace any human at that point.

NOW FOR THE IMPORTANT PART OF THIS POST:

Apart from the fact that we care about our existence because we are humans, why should it matter, in the grand scheme of things (in an evolutionary perspective), if human beings go extinct after they have created a ""race"" that has surpassed them in every way?

With this, I'm starting a debated I and can't wait to see your opinions. Please post only constructive comments people!

I am screaming internally because this is the closest I've ever gotten to a real, *paid* internship!! 

All the ones in my area are unpaid, and sadly I just can't afford to do them, no matter how much I would love to do zoo work. It's the reason I'm in a minimum wage campus job for the summer (but luckily the housing was free).

I know I have really solid references and supervisors, but I am **terrified** for the interview or other subsequent questioning that may occur. 


The job announcement did not include any hard start and end dates, so I'm hoping they would let me start this internship next spring semester, since I've already registered and paid for fall classes and housing. 


What I've learned from scouring the archives of this board (and /r/conservation ) is that experience and internships trump the piece of paper the degree is printed on. So I am willing to take a year off school to do this internship, if it means I will be more employable post graduation.

Soon I have to decide what I want to do with my life after school. I got a letter of acceptance for a medical technical assistant school and I am genuinely happy :).

I am not sure how significant these studies are I just started reading research papers, but here they are:

(4) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14970735 (5) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11071688

The last 2 seem to indicate only a low risk.

But I still am a bit concerned after all. What do you think about the risks of working in a lab? I have a part-time job in a lab right now working with EtBr and sometimes I catch myself worrying about even that even though it is not that bad. I know that I'll probably have to work with carcinogenics sooner or later and I don't want to be constantly in doubt about that. Maybe this is not the right field for me...even though it makes me really happy.

I mean, I read something like ""I know a girl with a PhD in molecular biology and 5 years of industry experience, it took her a year to find her current job and she works for $40k/y"", then go to another thread, and there's a guy who's happy with his job in the field and links a survey that says most molecular biologists working in industry receive well above $80k.

702,To Get a Master's degree or not?,"Hi all, 

Long time lurker, but I think I have a unique problem that I'd like an outside perspective on. 

A little Background, I'm a BSc, in Microbiology, currently a FTE as a senior RA for a large pharma company, enjoying my job. My boss is pressing me to get a Master's degree (I've since applied and been accepted for a Masters Bioinformatics degree in the local city).

 I'm trying to decide whether this is a good option for me to take, seeing as how I'm a true wet lab purist and enjoy my position, I think the highest level a BSc or MSc can go anyways is 1 level higher than I'm at (Principal RA). I'm definitely not looking to be a Scientist or PhD level management within my company, so I think that is out of the question. 

As someone with a BSc with 4 years big pharma experience, 25 years old, do you even think MSc is appropriate for me at this point in my career? The schooling would be concurrent with work, i.e. 60-80% work as FTE, and full Master's courseload on top, as I cannot take any loans and must work to support myself throughout the degree.

Back when I used to do graduate admissions at an engineering school, when a potential student with no background in math asked about applying I would refer them to a math prep program like [this](https://netmath.illinois.edu/certificateprogram) one. The point being to give them the background they needed without going through a four-year degree (this is assuming they already had a four-year degree, just without the math).

With that in mind, I'm looking for something similar for biology - I'm interested in pursuing a graduate degree in genetics or possibly biomedical engineering (probably genetics). I majored in math and physics, but have no educational background in biology. Is there a program like that which anyone could recommend?

I had envisioned this as a distance learning program (like the one that I linked above) since I would be doing this before I went to school, but it occurs to me that some amount of lab work would be necessary to do proper preparation for biology.

For example, in transcription regulatory networks, at least two sets of nodes are represented, with one set representing genes and the other set representing transcription factors (TFs). The edges connect a node from one set to another and it represents the interaction between these two nodes. The edges are directed since some of the TFs are products of genes (these edges are directed with the arrows pointing towards the nodes representing TFs) whilst genes are regulated by transcription factors (these edges are directed with the arrows pointing towards the nodes representing genes). The same thing can be said with metabolic networks, two sets of nodes represent the metabolites and metabolic reactions and the direction of the edges that connect the nodes reveal whether the node representing a metabolite is a reagent or a product of the metabolic reaction.

732,"Masters or PhD in Biology, I'm conflicted","So i'm going to be a senior this coming fall in college earning a molecular biology degree. I was planning on going to graduate school, but I don't know what path is best for me. I have good grades (3.81 GPA), Will have two years of undergrad research experience during the school year plus two summer research programs that I was able to get in to. I'm a TA, and *hopefully* going to be a co-author to a publication that i'm currently working on with my PI in my current summer research program. My adviser said I can hopefully get into some decent grad programs (GRE score pending), but i'm not sure what route I should take, Masters or PhD. A PhD is kind of intimidating because that's a whole 4+ extra years in school so it's a large commitment, though most programs give you stipend for research that I've seen (I don't believe Masters programs do as they're only 1-2 years?) 

My future aspirations, I know I do NOT want to go into academia; completing a postdoc, researching and teaching at a University and trying to get grants for research does not interest me at all. What interests me is developmental biology/stem cell research and its applications in studying human disease and medicine/treatments for those diseases. I can see myself doing research, but not my whole life. I'd enjoy to work in government or private sector studying developmental bio/stem cells in relation to human health impact and disease research and treatment. That can involve biomedical companies, pharmaceutical industries, research firms, etc. Possibly move from research-based within the sector to more of a higher end management position. 

From what I've researched, either option is a good option, but what i'm wondering if I really need the PhD from what can be accomplished with a Masters. I've heard pros and cons for both, that for a PhD you really get to dive into a specific field you enjoy and work extensively and get a stipend, whereas a masters (obviously) takes less time, and I've even heard that some career paths look at Masters grads in a better light than PhDs, because Masters are 'younger' and more open to experimentation and flexibility whereas PhDs are 'set in their ways' (don't know how true that is). I've also heard that sometimes you can work out an internship/job with a company/industry while earning your Masters/PhD so you gain professional experience while you earn your undergrad, then you have a job right after graduation. 

My biggest thing is that, I don't want to feel I wasted time and effort into a PhD program when I could accomplish and achieve the same or better career opportunities from just a Masters. I want to have somewhat of a personal life for relationships and experiences, and some people say it's difficult to have that in a tough PhD program. Does anybody have any advice/personal experiences that could make this decision easier? There's just so many career paths out there in the biomedical sector that's it's really hard for me to pinpoint what I want to do. It's just very stressful.


tl;dr: Interested in Developmental Bio/Stem Cell research in biomedical industry to study disease, trying to figure out if a PhD is worth the time and effort compared to a Masters which both could potentially get me to the same place in life.

I am a PhD student in cellular and molecular biology focusing on iPSC research. I'm entering my sixth (and last) year as a graduate student and am slowly wrapping up my project and intend to submit a manuscript for publication over the next several months. 

I have a couple of questions I hoped anyone with experience could chime in on:

-Is publishing in an open-access journal actually that looked down on still? I've been thinking of submitting to an outlet like PLoS One but some of my colleagues rag on them a lot, and I'm worried that it might be a drag on my resume. I like the idea of open-access though, and I like that my data could be published quickly.

-I've seen colleagues have entire studies dismantled and have to be redone over reviewer comments. While sometimes I know this is called for, I am really not keen on the idea of spending another year addressing reviews. I've tried to anticipate what a reviewer will ask already, but of course I can never predict. If my study gets sent back with a large amount of revision needed, is it ok to just say ""thanks but no thanks"" and resubmit elsewhere? Again, I am also trying to graduate and this paper is one hurdle to that, so time is something I am concerned about. 

-Is impact factor *really* that big of a deal? I've felt comfortable submitting to smaller journals but my PI is set on attempting a larger journal first. I've heard the review process isn't really any different between the two, just that there is more competition for who is eventually published.

741,What are the main reasons for cholesterol flux to/from cell membrane in animal cells?,"As I understand it, cholesterol, with regards to cell membrane, adds integrity and fluidity or stability (depending on temperature). So it makes sense that LDL-P would deposit cholesterol where those properties are needed.

But what is the reason why cholesterol might need to be removed? What would signal for ABCA1 activation within a cell, thus allowing interaction of HDL-P to take up cholesterol out of the cell membrane?

Logic tells me that for some cell functions to take place, sometimes it needs to lose some cholesterol and other times it needs to gain cholesterol. For example, if a particular function needs to happen and it requires a lipid raft to form, LDL-P would be signaled to release some cholesterol to that cell. And when that raft has served it's purpose, HDL-P (via increased ABCA1 expression).

This is purely speculation of what I THINK cholesterol flux is for but:

1. I'm not a scientists at all, just a science hobbyist but I'm a computer programmer hah!
2. I can't find anything (don't know where/how to look) that might explain this.

I'm just trying to understand enough to look at cholesterol and HDL/LDL in a new perspective as opposed to just ""LDL IS BAD/HDL IS GOOD!"". Understanding these things, I think, opens up a big black hole of... well what happens when you have derranged ABCA1. Would your body try to produce more HDL (like when you have insulin resistance, your body creates more insulin)? Then would your doctor tell you your HDL is great when in fact there is another problem going unnoticed and HDL is high for the wrong reason?

I am trying to extract RNA right after a positive selection of cells with dynabeads and I am struggling with it, as I get very low RNA yields.

My procedure is:
- I isolate some cells from lung tissue using dynabeads. I get between 400'000 and 800'000 cells, which are coupled to the beads. I cannot culture the cells nor remove the beads from the cells.
- Right after the isolation, I put the cells coupled to beads on a magnet to discard their buffer and replace it by RLT lysis buffer from Qiagen RNeasy mini plus kit. (Surely this looses some cells with this additional wash step, but I didn't have a better idea?)
- I vortex the sample for 1 min to lyse the cells.
- Then I centrifuge the sample at 4C, to remove the beads and to work on the supernatant which hopefully contains RNA without beads (as they may clog RNA columns?)
- I then add beta-mercaptoethanol, vortex, and freeze to -80 for later extraction. I add the BME now, as I've seen beads are not compatible with reducing reagents.
- then for RNA extraction, I thaw the sample, vortex for 1min to homogenise, and proceed with Qiagen RNeasy mini plus kit. Finally I quantify RNA using nanodrop. I get between 10-30 ng/uL and the purity is not good (the curve looks really wrong).

I am quite new to this so I may do a step wrong, but has anyone of you tried to extract RNA from cells still attached to beads? I would be happy with any suggestion/remark as I'm going crazy with it :)

769,Comparing the effects of an actinobacteria and fungi against bacteria under heat stress - Research Paper,"I am doing an IB High School biology research and experiment extended essay on antimicrobials. I’m interested in actinobacteria and fungi as they are organisms that naturally produce antibiotics. I will be testing their effectiveness against bacteria. I was thinking of adding a twist by seeing the response to heat stress and if putting them under stress conditions will increase their effectiveness against the E. coli. For example, I will have petri dishes cultivated with an actinobacteria and a fungi (which both are known to produce antibiotics) and grow them under optimal conditions and at higher temperatures. Currently, my research question is how does heat stress affect the ability of Penicillium chrysogenum and Streptomyces griseus to inhibit the bacterial growth of Micrococcus luteus? I did do research on the temperature range and they are actually around the same (Optimal Temperature - Streptomyces: 26 degrees Celsius, Penicillium: 23 to 28 degrees Celsius, ). As for the significance, since most antibiotics used in modern medicine are produced from organisms such as fungi and actinobacteria, if climate change affects these organisms, the application of human medicine in turn may be affected as well. Also, these organisms use antibiotics as a way to protect their food supply from bacteria, so if temperature changes affect their ability to produce antibiotics, it will affect their ability to compete. Do you guys have any suggestions on how I can do my experiment? Concerns? Changes? Or things I should consider?

Chromids are basically large replicons which are secondary to the main chromosome of a bacteria. It usually has a larger size than a typical plasmid and a bacterium can possess one or more of these replicons. It has the following characteristics:

* Chromids have plasmid-type replication and partitioning systems;
* Chromids have a nucleotide composition close to that of a chromosome;
* Chromids carry core genes that are found on the chromosome in other species;

Never in my university years did I encounter the concept of ""plasmid-type"" and ""chromosome-type"" replication systems. I have always assumed that the replication mechanisms of both these circular DNA molecules are the same (enzymes gather in an origin of replication, replisomes form and proceed in both directions from the origin of replication, synthesizing new DNA using the old replicon as a template).

Logic behind this idea: stem cells and cancer cells are very very similar, except cancer cells never differentiate and don't know when to stop. Maybe the RNA transcripts and proteins inside both of them are similar...

And the reason for the FIRST seemingly unnecessary SCNT was to isolate the damaged nucleus, from the rest of the cell that probably has damaged mitochondria. We don't want our new cells to have mitochondrial DNA damage!

Unfortunately we did not observe a blood type specific binding. Our hypotheses for this so far are:

a) The bacteria ate the carbohydrate linkers since the linkers were neither protected nor secured
b) The layer of mucin was missing
c) And generally the study was done in vitro and therefore lacks the complexity found in vivo

886,Questions about returning to school for biology and jobs.,"I am seriously thinking about going back to school for biology, however I am a bit unsure of the best path to take. I think I would like to do private sector research and maybe think about Academia in the very long term. Academia is just a pipe dream right now, I don't want to deal with being an adjunct or trying to get funding yet.

I currently have a bachelors in psychology, however I worked in a neuroscience lab as an undergraduate and was even published as a co-author. I am wondering if I were to get a second bachelors or a masters in biology, would I be employable in the US and Europe? This might be something I shouldn't care about professionally, but I have always wanted to move abroad to work, and possibly stay. I've lived in and seen basically all of America and I'm looking for a change.

Secondly, I'm not sure whether to pursue a masters, or a bachelors. I have looked around here, and it seems a masters is definitely best for career options as a research associate, but financially I don't know if I can justify that. I may have to get a bachelors first and then get a masters later on. I don't know that I could get in to a masters program for biology as it is. I have decent grades and lab experience, but only three bio/chem courses behind me. I feel like I will have to take some undergrad biology courses either way. To add to this, would it be reasonable to do undergrad courses through something like ASU online? I am worried about some kind of stigma against an online degree (I would only do this if I took the bachelor's degree option or to catch up on classes before applying for a masters). 

Lastly, will I need to specialize in a degree like microbiology for instance, or will general biology plus lab experience be more than enough? I'm interested in doing as much work as it takes to be a great job candidate, but not in going unnecessarily deeper into debt. Luckily my student loans are pretty manageable right now, but I know after a second undergrad or a masters I will need to find a decent job, fast.

Thanks for any insight into these questions. I know its a lot, but I've felt pretty overwhelmed with all of the details of this decision and I thought y'all could provide some excellent advice.",biology,1498505085,JuanofLeiden,3,2,True,2017-06-26

Hence, in the extra H bond, the hydrogen has less positive charge (due to lack of  inductive effect) which is not enough for H bond formation.

Edit 2: it's my fault I suppose. I personally like to have a more detailed background so I can formulate a more precise and informed reply. Apparently it has the inverse effect on other people. 
So I have removed the ""why I am asking"" portion that made up the original post. 

Let's assume the following factors:
--Slightly higher body mass- I'm 5'11"", more muscle mass than average females but also a little more than optimal adipose tissue. 
--No alcohol consumption during the period in question, and not much in general
--Single cup of tea or coffee daily
-- Less than 8oz of protein consumption daily. 
--Within the RDA of dairy consumption daily
--No dietary supplements
--No diuretics or other medications associated kidney function. 
--No diabetes, high blood pressure, or issues related to fluid retention or edema

998,Question about gel results,"Hi, 

I'm doing undergraduate research at my university and I'm just trying to wrap my head around the presence/absence of bands on my gel. 

So, we inserted a gene (yadD) with a mutated intra promoter into a pwm1015 plasmid and then transformed the yadD/pwm1015 plasmid into DH5-alpha cells. What's nice about the plasmid I'm using is that it had a gfp sequence, so if the mutated promoter is knocked out, the colonies won't fluoresce. 

Anyways, I grew up my plate and 8 colonies grew. My research department just got a bioimager so we were able to view which colonies were were fluorescing and which weren't before we PCR'ed them and ran them on a gel. On the plate, 4 out of 8 colonies lacked fluorescence. 

Out of the 8 lanes, my gel had 4 lanes with 1 band in each, while the other 4 lanes had no bands present. So, my question is, even if 4 of the colonies didn't have a mutated promoter, why don't those lanes show up with a band on the gel? If the reason that they fluoresced is because the pwm1015 plasmid didn't ligate with the yadD after digest, the pwm1015 plasmid still contains DNA and should show up at a certain BP on the ladder, right?

I'm planning on asking my PI about it tomorrow morning, but I figured I'd ask here first and see if anyone could clear it up for me.

If they are practically equal to a mouse in mental and physiological nature then they should have equal rights. 

I thought of this by initially thinking about how you could synthesise a human body without a brain. It would be basically a more complex equivalent to using stem cells to grow lumps of tissue (people have grown like heart cells in a tray and pass an electrical charge through to see it beat, also we already to testing on human tissues that are synthesised).

The main issue with no brain though is you don't get to see the medicine's effects on the brain. Also it would be far more intricate to grow a body without a brain than to just GE dumber humans.

Over all you could GE the new humans so tests on them are more ethical than tests on rats, because by the time we have the ability to use GE to making a human mind relatively equal to a mouse's, we can probably stop pain and even consciousness.

I have the following question in my homework:

So after rereading this question a million times I believe i may have a way determining the answer, however i fear my way may be wrong. 

I was thinking that i need to take the atomic mass that was provide in the previous question for the following elements (C, H, O) and add them all together. The total atomic mass equals 169 i would take that number and divide it by the weight 180 grams and that will give me my answer? I don't know and i am honestly lost. Any help is really appreciated.

About a year ago, my lovely cat brought me the gift of a dead, small bird, about the size of a hand. 
So, me trying to study anatomy at that time, I decided to take advantage of the opportunity- and get the skull of the bird. So, using a pocket knife, tweezers, and cotton, I got the skull of the bird. 
Heres where it gets fun. It smelled like abysmal death and sadness. So, me, still wallowing in how cool the skull was, got a genius idea. I got a tiny bit of polyester stuffing, stuffed it into where the brain of the bird was, and then dunked the whole amalgamation into diluted vanilla extract.
An hour later, it came out smelling like vanilla. And it still remains so today.

I am part of a large lab that currently has no concise way of keeping anything digital related well organized. Preferably I would like to use a web tool that can be accessed free and from anywhere.


Here are some of the types of data I would like to organize and make accessible for everyone to view and edit:

-Colony data: we have a colony of animals (about 1,000). We need to have access to census info that includes origin of specimen, ID, cage, year of collection, species and keep track of projects they are being used for or have been used for. 

-Protocols and purchase information

-Specimens: specimens produced from field collections or breedings in the lab as well as any animals that were part of the colony but died in captivity. Our specimens are kept in ethanol or frozen. 

-Projects and experiments: I want to keep track of the specimens used in each project. Sometimes a single specimen will be used for multiple projects. 

-Data: we have all sorts of files, most commonly we use excel. We also have video, jpg, sound and R files along with a bunch of sequencing files that I do not understand. 


Anyways, I am mainly looking for a way to organize the lab, so that when we have new members I can direct them there to get all the information they may need. My adviser is great but slightly digitally inept and it is hard to keep anything organized. I am currently in charge of orienting new members around the lab and my job is hell when I have to sift through billions of files to find the exact one they need. It's also hard to keep anything up to date when I have to find files that have multiple copies. I need some help. Tell me what you use and I will check it out, give it a try.

229,Graduate degree for research management?,"Hi all!

I'm seeking advice on what to study in graduate school to help advance my career. I have three years of experience working in research management and research compliance. I'm currently working at a university in a research compliance role managing administrative activities for IRB, IACUC, and IBC committees. It's a pretty interesting role for now, but eventually I want to move into management in this field. 

Luckily, the university I work for allows me to take classes toward a master's degree at the school. I'm looking at programs in Biology, Health Policy, and Public Health that are offered by the school. I'm also interested in a few programs at a nearby Ivy: Public Health, Bioethics, Organizational Dynamics, Social Policy. I'm not sure which degree would be the most beneficial. 

My concerns: the school I work for is quite small and is relatively unknown outside of my state. I'm concerned that an MS degree from this school won't mean much. An Ivy degree is much more attractive, but is also terribly expensive. 

Also, is it worth stopping at an MS or should I plan to obtain a PhD? I don't want to work in a lab. I'm interested in research compliance/administration work. 

A little about me: I'm 25 with a BA in Biological Sciences.

Yeah, I know.

My question is, is this DNA usable? I guess there would be two causes for concern: the first being the act of leaving the DNA at room temperature for around 60 hours, and the second being the fact that I left the tubes floating in nonpure water for the same length of time.

I had tubes of both bacterial and eukaryotic purified genomic DNA, all rehydrated in molecular-grade H20 (originally in dried form with 1x TE buffer). I had screwed the caps on reasonably tightly, but I'm not sure if there was a risk of the ice water entering the tubes via infiltrating the cap threading.

2. Help the life of a lot of people, i read a study that some reasearchers did genetic test on young children and people with rudiment for diabetes got delayed 5 years because the doctors knew the children that were most likely going to get the dissease and tried to delay it as good as possible. That probably help a lot of children.

Although i thought there must be some limits, when has it went to far? A question that has been going through my mind because at the moment I can only see positive things about it, but there is probably etics and etc involved. What do you guys think?

255,Graduate school preparation advice?,"So a little bit of a back story: I'm Canadian, I live in a small province, small town and go to a small university, and I've recently become very fortunate in finding a professor who has agreed to take me on as a Master of Science student in Molecular Biology at a very large university (30,000+ students) in a very large province. I'm just in the process of submitting my formal application, but I've been told as long as I meet the requirements and I have my supervisor secured, there shouldn't be any reason I would be declined, although I'm still holding my breath because of the chance I still might be. I've also been very fortunate that my potential supervisor has offered me a job in his lab over the summer as well to make the move smoother since it is such a large distance, and I can gain some experience before starting in the fall. 

Basically I'm kind of overwhelmed at this point. I've lived in a small town my whole life and I'm used to this kind of lifestyle, but now I'm potentially being thrown into a very different lifestyle in a few months time. I've lived at home thus far, so living on my own will be a challenge on its own. I'm planning to live in the graduate housing at the university because it comes with furniture and makes things easier, although I'm not sure if I'll be able to over the summer before I start so that worries me a bit as well. I'm also planning to fly out instead of drive, so I'm not bringing much with me. I'm just wondering if anyone else who has done this has any advice on making such a big transition from undergraduate to graduate school in this way. I also don't know anyone in the area and it's not like an undergraduate degree where it's probably easier to get to know a bunch of people at the university so I'm hoping to meet a few people so that my graduate studies doesn't consume my soul.

How on Earth are these interpreted? What does the ""thick""/primary bar represent? The mean? The median? The lowest value? What does the extended bar represent? The highest value? The 95% percentile? Why is there never a corresponding visible ""lowest"" extended bar visible?

Sorry, I understand that like, everyone in the field knows how to interpret these charts, because they are incredibly common. However, surely there are better ways of representing data, such as boxplots, notched boxplots, violin plots, grouped scatter plots? Why do people use this method?

Edit: It's also possible that there's no standard - the paper this example is from does explicitly mention that data ""is presented as mean±SEM"", where I've definitely seen it as SD in other places. Assuming that means that the that the thick bar is the mean and the extended bar is the mean + SEM, it's still annoying that these plots fail to visualize the low end of the SEM. Also, I've seen it used in examples with extremely low sample sizes (here n=4-5, the worse I've seen is n=2) where surely it would be better to show all obtained values or the entire range than a statistical metric.",biology,1452976143,woodcan,18,12,True,2016-01-16

Okay so AMP is basically ATP missing 2 phosphate groups. ATP undergoes hydrolysis in a cell, 1/2 phosphate groups break off, and this releases energy.

Glucose is used in aerobic respiration to synthesis ATP. So higher levels of glucose result in higher levels of ATP as more of the ADP/AMP are converted to ATP during oxidative phosphorylation. 

So, in high levels of glucose, more ADP/AMP is converted to ATP, so AMP levels drop. In low levels of glucose, less ATP is synthesized, so less ADP/AMP are converted to ATP, so there are higher levels of AMP.

Is this correct ? Do I have the right idea ? Thanks.",biology,1453057762,I_Am_Not_Lorenzo,5,9,True,2016-01-17

I graduated in December with a B.S. in Molecular and Cell Biology. I did not get many research opportunities at my school and tried my best to remedy that by taking classes that were only labs -- for one semester, I spent upwards of 15-20 hours in the lab working on my own independent research project.

I didn't get a lot of good advice (or any advice, in general), preparing me for post-grad life, so I was hoping to get some here.

I would like to return to grad school to pursue biochemistry or microbiology, but I would like some concrete experience in a laboratory before I apply -- not only to bolster my application, but also to make sure I am making the right decision in terms of career choices.

I don't think I will be able to find a job as a technician with so little formal experience, but I live near an ivy league school with many biotech and pharmaceutical companies in the area as well, so I would think I might be able to find an opportunity to work for free. I would like to be able to find something where I can work for the experience.

I am really floundering when it comes to finding or making opportunities for myself. I reckon cold calling PIs would probably be a good start, but I am unsure how to approach this strategy and whether it will actually be successful.

My reasoning was, lets say I got an eye mutation, which favours my eyesight and increases my darwanian fitness. Lets say there is selection on this charasteristic. I get more offspring, which, following the natural selection criteria, should also have better sight. However, I don't understand how my children would get these positive alleles. How does the mutation ""transport"" to the spermcells and become heritable. How does this (positive) mutation become fixed?

I am soon finished with my master thesis. I studied nature conservation and ecology, my thesis is about stress respond of *Abies Alba* (climate change - dendroecology - genetics; these were the 3 building blocks of my thesis. So I have exp. in field work, DNA extraction and counting/measuring tree rings ;-) ) Of course I am also familiar with the basics in ""R"" and other software tools.


Now the difficult part: 

I do not want to make my doctor and preferably work outside. I have no problem with traveling, but as student I am always pretty broke.


So, where should I start searching? Any beginner tips (websites/apps/whattsapp or fb groups?). I know I won't get rich from this work, but it would be great if I could pay my expenses.
Internship and Trainee seem better than volunteering.  I want to learn more about field work and of course see more of the world :-)
While browsing through the net i find plenty of organizations, but you have to pay a huge amount of money for working there (+ flight + rent + food...).


Btw. i am from Germany, so most offers from New Zealand or the USA are a bit complicated (Visum etc.). And I am an introvert person. Teamwork is great, but teaching or lecturing would be my weakness.

(Of course I have countries I would rate over other :-D Nepal would be amazing or Iceland).

My professor told me that the ancient organisms used energy sources from the environment such as UV light, lightning, volcanic eruptions and other things to the nature.

She started off with a very anti-abortion statement about how the full title of The Origin of Species helped inspire the ""murder of 57 million innocent lives by one American woman,"" leaving us to take a stab at who she was talking about, finally telling us, ""Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood.""

Now, I'm not a biologist, obviously, but I'm no stranger to biology - I've spent years studying a wide variety of things on my own just out of curiosity, so this stuff immediately raised some red flags, as I've not heard of either of these even once.

495,"Thoughts on a path, post-undergrad","Sorry in advance for the long post. This is more a question of advice than a post looking for any definite answers. I'm at a point in my life where I have the opportunity to move forward, but I'm torn in several directions, and would like some advice on how to look into each option and weigh it fairly and wisely.

#Some quick background on me:
- I graduated with a B.Sc in biology and psychology, thinking I wanted to go to medical school (neuro was what I was interested in). At the end of undergrad, I decided that med school wasn't what I wanted to do.
- I took some time to figure out what I did want to do after graduating, which turned into almost three years of doing absolutely nothing related to science.
- I decided to apply for grad school programs in neuroscience, but I had no real lab experience, and needed to relearn what I'd forgotten over three years. So I applied for a job in a lab, with the idea that I'd get some lab experience, perhaps get my name on a paper or two, and meanwhile prepare for application to grad school.
- I got a job in a cardio lab at a well-known university, which hired me as a tech, but on a very limited basis and with very little pay. To supplement this, I also got a job at a fruit-based tech company.
- For the past year, I've been working three days a week in the lab, and the other four at the other place. That's my current situation.

#Current thoughts:
- What I thought would become a good step towards applying for grad school has become a disappointment for me. The fact that I'm only in lab three days a week is (rather predictably) a problem. The other job is a necessity. I just wouldn't make enough money to get by working in the lab alone. I've basically been pigeonholed into the role of favor boy in the lab. Ordering lab supplies, doing odd favors for people. None of my own projects, as time won't really allow it. No real involvement in the projects of others. I got middle authorship on one paper, but I don't feel as though I've grown or learned anything in the year that I've been in lab.
- Working seven days a week for a year has tired me out. I haven't really had time to study and prepare for grad school the way I planned to. My job at the tech company is fun, but definitely not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I absolutely want to go to grad school and move forward in life.

#On the subject of grad school:
- My initial thought was that I wanted to go to med school. That is no longer my goal. I don't have an interest in the clinical aspect of med school, and I don't have an interest in the lifestyle of a doctor.
- My second inclination was a grad program in neuroscience, as that is my interest. However, after having worked in a lab, I feel that my taste for biomedical research has soured. Whether or not that's because of my current working situation is another story. If I'm to continue down the neuroscience path, would it be more advantageous to seek out a wider field within grad school, and use that knowledge to work in neuroscience-based labs? That way, my knowledge and experience would be more marketable, and I'd be less likely to be without a job than with something as specialized as a neuroscience degree?
- My final inclination is something that I've always considered, but never made any real steps of pursuit towards. Some sort of grad program in ecology/environmental science. The presteige of the job of doctor has always made me think that I wanted to go into some medicine-related field, so it's been the basis of my educational pursuits. If medicine, or biomedical research is not my calling in life, now is the time to decide. Ecology and environmental science have always been interests of mine, and something that I could see myself being happily involved with for the rest of my life.
- If I'm to weigh any of these options out, I think a good first step is to start reading scientific papers to see which speak to me. I'd use those papers to backtrack, and look into the labs that wrote them.

Looking at ourselves as humans is there any biological function we do without positive or negative reinforcement? We eat because it makes us feel good and we feel horrible if we stop eating. The same with drinking, we get thirsty. If we choose to hold our breath it makes us very uncomfortable until we start breathing again. The same with trying to hold our bladder or fecal matter without going to the bathroom.

With all that out of the way don't things such as reproduction in ALL animals require the same sort of positive or negative reinforcement if they haven't evolved orgasms?

The outbreak is not of a new strain of the virus.  
The outbreak happened because average temperatures in the affected area increased into the ideal range for the virus to thrive.  
Thus, everyone who died is a climate change fatality.  
  
I have struggled to find details on this since, but if the first two claims seem plausible, and the third would seem to follow from them.

I'm reading an [article](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/304957.php) about how some scientists developed a protocol that allows you to study a cell's transcriptome and DNA methylation along side each other, but there are a few things that are above my head.  

What does ""heterogeneity in DNA methylation"" mean?  Does it mean that DNA methylation in cells causes heterogeneity between the cells of an organism because of the way DNA methylation causes genes to be expressed?  

Also, if anyone actually knows what this ""protocol"" is, I'd love to know.  

Why is it important to be able to look at the transcriptome and DNA methylation at the same time?  How are consistencies seen when these two things are contrasted?  I can't picture it in my head.

I found myself having the time of my life listening to Chemistry, biology and genetics and physics these last last few years. I'm really happy to have found such a life interest but not exactly satisfied by the explanations given in my courses: there are only but a few mentions of quantum mechanics and the name itself is never spoken. When I approach the subject people usually gives a negative feedback or at best get a big question mark. I fear my program is behind in terms of scientific updates.

I happen to have read on Quantum Mecanics in hope of getting the gist of it, I have this dreadful fascination for it and can't unsee. I like to think It gave me a bigger picture on chemistry and biology. I have learning disabilities that leads me to Dyslexia and dyscalculia although I managed managed maths logic relatively well so far. 

I would love to know about the experience from people around quantum biology. How heavily physics rely on it? what are the specific abilities one must have to strive in the field of study? basically I would like to know how realistic of this ambition could be as I did chose my branch as an alternative to getting shredded by misplacing numbers...

If anyone could recommend a good reading about the subject It would make my day. I don't really know where to start looking.

I think I'm going to put emphasize on the part of porifera helping the oceans and water by filtering water. However,

1. How does it excatly help the oceans that they filter? I read something about ammoniak and nitrogen but wasn't a very reliable source. But i was rather thinking that it might help corals in some way?

2. Is there any other way they could possible help the eco system? I've read about fungi helping eco systems, but porifera is much less evolved animal. So I'm not really sure how poriferas, or one species of Porifera would do that!

3. Do you perhaps know any species of Porifera that is very interesting to learn more about and why? I for instance read something about ""Spongilla lacustris"" and symbiosis with alga But hmm that dosen't really convince me! And didn't find very much more information!

636,Do invasive plants cause extinctions ?,"I am a member of of a soil erosion group on facebook and in that group I have been exposed to the idea that introducing plant species physically can't cause another species to go extinct or that we don't have to worry about for a while because ecosystems aren't oversaturated with plant species.

I find this hard to believe. I f.e. don't see how this makes sense. Can somebody backup or refute this and explain why this is/n't true ?

I guess I will go in a little more detail on why I am sceptical. 

1: We know that competition is important to plant species like to any other species.

2: We know that drastic changes can happen plant communities (see succession f.e.) and that local extinctions can happen in that process.

3: While a plant can dominate an area even if another species is more suited to the soil, lighting ect it can be displaced after a disturbance.

4: Plant species aren't able to both coexist and completely share a niche, right ?

If you got time can you also shed light on low extinction rates of plants on pacific islands compared to f.e. birds (related to distribution ability and randomized extinctions ?). Here is an article  comparing these extinction rates http://biology.unm.edu/jhbrown/Documents/Publications/SaxGaines%26Brown2002AmNat.pdf

Edit: I came upon this article (below this paragraph), where it is directly stated in the first sentence of the abstract that exotic plants have caused the extinction of a few plant species, although not very many. I have yet to go into this further, maybe these were not worldwide extinctions. I am not sure there are definte examples either, but the authors, do ""come from the other side of the argument""). http://www.pnas.org/content/105/Supplement_1/11490.full",biology,1454626254,olvirki,16,24,True,2016-02-04
637,Biomedical science vs Medical Lab science,"I'm currently a 2nd year Biology major, and for most of those two years my plan was to switch to MLS after getting into a program for an MLS fourth-year internship. 

Now that I'm in my second semester of my second year, I'm starting to have second thoughts about what I want to do. My GPA is unimpressive, only a 2.67, but that can be blamed on a shitty first year (last semester my semester GPA was a 3.1, and it's gone up each successive semester). I've been looking into the biomedical sciences major at my school. I go to a school that's big on research, and know a couple people who do research on-campus, so I'm wondering if I should instead switch to biomedical sciences, study my dick off, and get into research for class credits to max out the number of credits I'm taking, then apply for my school's Cell Biology MS program, having hopefully made myself a known quantity to the professors in that program. 

What attracted me to the MLS major is the job security, however the pay isn't impressive, and it seems higher with biomedical sciences/cell biology. Moreover, part of me has always wanted to go into research, and what's more is that my school offers a deal where 9 credits are free to grad students working as either TAs or research assistants.

We us Indium Tin Oxide coated glass plates. And we do photolithography to etch the pattern of the electrode lanes on to the plates.  

Currently we are having difficulty with the continuity of the electrode lanes. The mask that we use for the pattern has lanes that are 8 microns wide throughout the whole plate. And once photolithography is we examine the plates and find breaks/cuts in the lanes, ruining that lane, and if we have more than 5 lanes ruined the plate as whole is ruined. 

We believe the problem could be from a couple of things, but given the lack of information on MEA fabrication we aren't sure which direction to follow. We think it may be that have old photoresist (could lead to poor adherence  to the ITO), it could be the cleaning process prior to beginning photolithography, could be under or over developing in KOH, could be under/over etching in HCl. But we don't know and don't have enough resources to continue experimenting.

So I am currently a sophomore working on my undergrad in biology at a state school. My current major is biology but I'm thinking about switching over to microbiology. I was recently interested in med school but after reading post after post from current doctors and med students, it just doesn't seem worth it at this point (endless debt and 80+ hour work weeks for years on end). So at this point I'm looking to get into the biotechnology field and I'm trying to figure out what my next step is. From reading around of this sub and other websites, I'm planning on trying to get my PhD in biotechnology and hopefully aiming to get a job in industry.

I just have a few questions that I was hoping someone could answer.

1) What should my short term goals/plans be (next two years of undergrad)?. I know I definitely need lab experience and I'm going to try and pair up with a professor next semester to get as many hours in the lab as I can. My current gpa is a 3.4, which I realize isn't as high as I want it to be, but the reason it is so low is just my because I wasn't serious when I first got here. My first semester freshman year, I earned a 2.6, but following that I earned a 3.6 and then a 3.8 last semester. I've already retaken one class I got a C in and replaced it with an A and am doing the same this semester. My goal by graduation is no lower than 3.65 gpa. If I keep up what I'm doing now hopefully it will be higher but I'm just trying to keep everything within reason.

2) In terms of graduate programs, I definitely want to get into a program that stands out. I think it is definitely still feasible at this time, I just have to stay consistent with my studying and get the lab hours. Does anyone have any recommendations for particular schools? I'm realistic and understand I'm not going to get into Harvard or Stanford or Johns Hopkins, but one school in particular that stood out to me was Northwestern. I know they're a very well respected school I want to set a goal for myself and try to achieve it. I'm very determined to do the best I can so I want to aim for one of the best that's within my grasp.


3) Last thing, for anyone who is currently in the field, are there any tips you could give an aspiring undergrad that you wished you knew at this time? I want to maximize my potential and I think this is the best place to come to for advice.

Do you think this is worthwhile? Should I pursue a masters degree for the sole purpose of fulfilling my dream of being an adjunct professor? Do you think the income generated by teaching would ever pay off the student debt I would take to get my masters degree?

I'm mostly worried that since I don't have an ecology or biology major I won't be able to get into a graduate program for Ecology. I also have a 3.12 GPA and an advisor told me when I first got into my program that a 3.5 is what to shoot for to do grad school but at that time I didn't think I would want to do grad school and I had pretty bad study habits. I'm talking to my advisor tomorrow but I wanted the input of everyone here that's been through this process already. Thanks!,biology,1454957552,zacktyzwyz,5,1,True,2016-02-08

I'm currently an undergraduate going for a Biology major, of course, and I would like to start reading about past and recent advances beyond my current education. Don't get me wrong, I believe I'm getting an excellent education with where I'm at now; this is mainly for when I'm not attending classes during the semester. I'm not too deep into my major just yet; still working on the general Biology courses.

Right now my emphasis is Zoology, though not necessarily in veterinary practice; so that may help narrow things down a bit. I do enjoy learning about plants, fungi, evolution, and genetics too.

I haven't heard of many journals or magazines relating to Biology; the only two I've heard of are *Nature* and *National Geographic* (I know the latter has a lot more of a variety of topics other than Biology). I'll try to remember to ask my professors if they know of any good ones I can check out.

706,Fish and Pain perception,"OK, I am speaking as both an aspiring biologist but also a keen catch-and-release Angler. The question ""do fish feel pain"" is one that has always been put in the face of marine biologists and anglers. If one were to Google the question you would see news reports saying they do but some saying they don't (the latest says they don't), you would also see animals rights groups such as PETA blasting anglers. 

But really, there does not seem to be any solid answer out there so  its become a very hard question to answer. From my experience as an Angler I don't quiet believe fish feel pain whilst on a hook because assuming they were able to feel pain like say a Dog (As PETA has put it before) why on earth do they pull so hard, if you're in such immense pain, you wouldn't pull but rather move towards to relieve the tension wouldn't you. I am also certain that at places that get fished a lot, the fish almost get used to being caught as they seem to be very calm and often swim off peacefully (they are even caught more than once). If this is happening by Habituation, then clearly the hook must not affect them that much because the whole point behind habituation is that an animal gets used to a stimuli that doesn't really affect it.

I just finished a very tough MSc in Evolutionary Genetics from a University that has a very good name, but I'm not very happy with it. My BSc was in Molecular Bio and Genetics.

While I'm not bad at math *compared to an average student* and have even managed to publish some papers about biomodeling as an undergrad, I don't envision myself competing with super-talented math people at the graduate level who are ultimately expected to produce new knowledge primarily through mathematical tools (nor is mathematics something I draw my motivation from). Hence, I wonder:


1. **are there areas of comp.bio. (and related fields) where I can realistically contribute something to the field primarily as a software engineer** who also knows quite a bit about biology, but that can't be reduced to something that any programmer who knows nothing whatsoever about biology can do as well (i.e. technical work that doesn't get one listed as an author of papers)?
2. **would it be a mistake to pursue a PhD in the field if I'm not ready to transform myself into an applied mathematician** first who also happens to know some programming to solve problems, i.e. would it pretty much prevent me from getting research positions after graduation?   


&amp;nbsp;


*Additional background*  


My (perhaps incorrect) observation is that software engineers - even if they may be useful to a particular research group - don't seem to land tenure-track positions, or any kind of long-term research positions. From my observations based on papers from e.g. PLOS CompBiol, and investigation of research groups, as well as the job market, computational biology in practice seems to be mostly about:


- data analysis (bioinformatics) aka applied statistics and AI (machine learning);
- modeling of biological systems, which comes down to mathematical biology and biophysics.  
  
As a strong software engineer, I'd at best be an implementer which is not something that appears particularly valued in academic settings. Even seemingly interdisciplinary fields like synthetic biology (genetic circuit design etc.) are, upon investigation, really about the usual bioengineering (genetic engineering, biochemistry and other wet lab stuff) or about mathematics. One field I discovered that appears the closest to my strengths is bio-design automation, but there appear to be only a handful of groups doing it, and career prospects seem pretty bad. The viability/practical potential of many fields is also hard to estimate for me, especially since some (many?) topics appear to be over-hyped with an intention of getting grant money, and computation and biology are really not nearly as close as some would like us to believe (or so I've been told by some more cynical biologists).

This decision is further complicated for me because I'm getting software development job offers from top companies - but I've grown rather disillusioned with the corporate culture of software/IT industry, and the impact and intellectual stimulation are just not just quite the same - a field like comp.biol. is much more meaningful for me due to potential impact to solve actual problems of humanity. But if I can't be good at it, I'd rather seek something else.

-Vacuole= Hard drive
-Cell wall= Computer case
-Cell membrane= Firewall
-Nuclear envelope= CPU Socket
-Chloroplasts= Power Supply
-Cytoplasm= motherboard
-mitochondria= resistors
-Endoplasmic reticulum: motherboard circuits

Not quite sure on:
-Ribosomes= data/signals from cpu
-Nucleolus= CPU cores

-transport proteins
-chromatin
-golgi apparatus
-cytoskeleton (microtubulars or microfilaments)
-cilia or flagella

830,"I took photos of breast milk under the microscope when my baby was 2 months old. I'm about to take comparison shots at 1 year, and I'm wondering... is there a way to get further imaging done, to see white blood cells, antibodies, or some of the bacteria contained in milk?","Hi Reddit biologists!

Earlier this year, [I took photos of my breast milk under the microscope](http://www.thescientificmom.com/2015/03/the-liquid-gold-project-monitoring.html), milk that was produced for my 2 month old daughter. These photos ended up everywhere on Facebook, and ended up on sites like ""the stir"" and ""[Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/2015/05/29/breast-milk-gold/)"". I was able to get some fantastic photos of the fat content later on, and take some photos of how it changed during nursing. For example, there isn't as much fat in the first ""pulls"" from the baby, but those fat globules get pulled from the milk ducts and into the milk in greater quantities after ""let down"" (which is a stimulation of the ducts to release milk at a faster rate).

Anyway, I'm about to take the final comparison photos, where I can compare the content of milk for a one year old, and compare it to the milk for a two month old. But, while looking at the photos of the fat content is fascinating in itself, I'm wondering if there are ways I can get access to greater detail, or even more highly powered microscopes?

I'd love to see some of the bacteria that is apparently present in the milk as it goes from breast to baby. I'd also love to see some of the antibodies, or white blood cells that are present as well!
I know some of these things take some serious machinery to see. A scanning electron microscope would probably be required to see something like antibodies, or a detailed look at white blood cells...

Is this something I can inquire at a university to see? Can I take my samples into a place like ASU and work with their lab, or work with a biologist there? Or is there something I can do at home with my 1970's American Optical lab microscope to see these things better?

It's one thing to read through the scholarly articles and research papers, but it would be another thing entirely to see it right in front of me! To be able to share that with my older daughter as well, to share what our bodies are capable of producing for our young, would be incredible!

I'm not even sure if this IS something I can do, but I thought I would ask here. You guys have always been really great with supporting science and inquiry with the general public, so I figured if anyone would have any pointers, you would be the first place to check.

When a person receives a stem cell transplant, and they are tested for engraftment, how is it that different clusters are detected in different percentages? (For example, a person might have only 50% donor CD3, but also have 100% donor CD56.) I always imagined that the person was producing their own cells, plus the donor cells, and that the CDs should line up with that percentage across the board. In other words, if they are producing 90% donor cells, I imagined we'd see 90% CD3, and 90% CD56, etc. That is apparently wrong. So, how's it actually work?

899,"Use of animal serum when growing ""lab meat""?","I've heard the buzz increase again in the media related to lab grown, cultured meat. The idea is that instead of growing whole animals and then slaughtering them for meat, you isolate cells from a cow or pig or what-have-you (I'm sure some weirdos would be interested is using human cells as the starter) and then growing these cells in bioreactors until their mass has increased to the point where the tissue can be harvested and processed into meat products. 

However, as someone who has done tons of tissue culture work (for cancer research, not food science) I'm aware that to grow most of these cells, the growth media is usually between 5-20% animal serum (the non-cellular component of blood). In other words, if you need several liters of horse serum to make a few burgers, why not just eat the horse? You're killing the animal anyway.

Some cell lines can be grown without serum, however they typically still use some animal products, such as BPE (bovine pituitary extract - basically a ground-up pituitary gland from a cow brain). Again, the same problem.

It seems a little disingenuous of the researchers and start-up companies to underplay this aspect of the tissue culture process. This will also be a MAJOR cost in research and actual production to be able to generate (probably using bacteria, yeast, or insect cells) a growth medium that replaces all the nutrients and growth factors, etc found in the animal components of current media.

On a side note, this is also one of the issues that animal right's activists (with whom I commiserate on many issues) are unaware of when they make the claim that no animals need to be hurt if you just replace animal models (like mice and rabbits) with cell culture models.

So my questions are:

1) Since I am getting a degree in plain ""biology"" (my school didn't offer molecular biology, which I think is what most interests me), would I be able to get into a masters in molecular biology?

2) is it likely that someone with only a bit of research experience and a GPA of 3.66 to get into a fully funded masters program?

3) any advice for me? I figure I'll begin looking for lab tech jobs as soon as I graduate, but being the only one in my family with post-highschool level education, I haven't had a lot of guidance and have often been hesitant to ask peers and faculty (stupid I know) for advice regarding what getting a masters degree requires/entails/etc. I hope this post wasn't inappropriate for this particular subreddit, and I'm just trying to cast a net for advice on possible next steps.

946,"2nd year biology major in career crisis. Interest in animals. PLEASE, please help!!","Hello

I'm a sophomore at a pretty decent university in Chicago. I just declared my major this year. Specifically, it's biology with an ecology concentration and I also have a minor in Spanish.

I want to work with animals. I cannot see myself doing anything else. I don't think I CAN do anything else without being miserable as hell. I want to help animals, possibly rescue, or work in a zoo, something like that. Some job that allows me to interact with animals as much as possible. I met with a professor at my school today who offers biology research opportunities to students, and upon speaking with him, I realized that the doors that are opened with a biology major are, for the most part, doors I do not want to walk through. He does extensive research on developmental biology, specifically on anole lizards. He explained to me the different interests of the people who worked with him, and all involved some type of anatomy or physiology research but not as much interaction with the animals in the way I'm looking for. I am looking for a job that... I guess, that I can connect with animals more. More care/conservational stuff. It doesn't have to be domesticated animals, but I personally am not too interested in sole lab work or evolutionary biology or anything like that. Don't get me wrong, I love science and math. But the idea of research just doesn't strike a cord with me. 


So after talking with the professor, I proceeded to find myself in an utter panic. The careers that best fit my ""dream"" job (to my knowledge) require even LESS than a bachelors and make poor money (zookeeper, vet tech), or require me to become a DOCTOR. Vet school is unbelievably hard to get into, and while I get decent grades (3.45 GPA), I know that is on the way low end of the vet student spectrum and I have absolutely no supplemental experience with animals. I tend to think catastrophically, so right now I'm facing the terrifying thought of ""HOLY SHIT IM GOING TO BE BROKE AS HELL OR HAVE TO PULL OFF THE IMPOSSIBLE IN APPROX. 3 YEARS.""

PLEASE OH MY GOD if any of you have any advice for me, I would love to hear it. I was already planning on going to grad school; I wasn't planning on getting a PhD., but I'll do what it takes. I just can't make the cut as a vet. It's something that wasn't on my radar and I'm intimidated as hell.


**tl;dr: I'm looking for a hands-on career involving the care/conservation of animals, that doesn't require a doctorate, but requires more than just an associate/certificate! Preferably requires MS or PhD.**

Does it matter how long I've left academia to get back into academia?

I'm a bit conflicted here. I want to get my PhD but I've been struggling with depression for most my life and my motivation has shifted greatly throughout my BS/MS career. I'm trying to be realistic in a sense that I may need smaller accomplishments in the industry first before I take on a PhD. That and well, take care of my mental health.

How does it compare in salary, freedom in ideation, stress levels, stability, ability to move up in the company, demand?

My English level fortunately is not that bad but when I read about statistics, probabilities, differentials, I know that I'm not good enough to join one of those masters. Plus, the admissions are closed for most of those masters (not really a problem though, I can wait another year).

Or would it be absorbed and used to harden the exoskeleton?

I have a pretty wide range of interests - though I have narrowed them down to pretty much anything involving protein structure and molecular dynamics - which is why I tried to get as many technical/experimental skills through my research experiences. Grades having definitely been improving (mid 2.1 in my first year -&gt; very high 2.1 this year and expected a 1st next year, and hopefully it shall happen!)

I want to preferably go to the US to do my PhD, but I don't get the system. Should I contact labs that I have interests in even though the application process is through a committee rather than the PI choosing the student? I've read LORs are important, but here in the UK it would be impossible for me to get a non-science related one (we only do subjects of our major) and my science-related people will give me mildly enthusiastic letters not because I'm necessarily a bad student but because it's just the way things are here. It also doesn't help that my ""academic adviser"" won't be around next year. Also, I've been told either that most internationals get full funding in science OR that it's rare for internationals to get funding. What's up with that??

In short: I'm lost. What advice do you have for seniors applying (soon) for grad school? Anyone around that went from UK to US? Would it be worth taking a year off working as a research assistant/ lab tech even though I know I want to do a PhD?",biology,1407618610,gleeflea,10,6,True,2014-08-09

62,Help with Cell+Molecular Bio HW/study,"I have an exam coming up and we've been given a mock exam for practice, but I am struggling with the questions. I'm going to be pretty vague on exact details for each question, just so that I can work out the specifics for myself and hopefully learn how to do the work.

First question:
I have two molecules of dsDNA, I denature then renature them. Which would require the lower renaturation temperature? 
Both strands have the same (G+C)/(A+T) ratios and are the same size, so I then thought that the difference would be due to the difference in free energy of each doublet, but I can't seem to find a table or anything that would give me values for eukaryotic doublet free energies. Am I right or wrong here?

Second question: When finding the number of bidirectional forks used in the replication of eukaryotic DNA I went (number of bp)/(time in secs)/(no. of forks)= replication in bp/sec/fork. But I need to know the number of bidirectional forks, so I would just divide the (no. of forks) number by two? (I am given the rate in bp/sec/fork)

Third question: I am told the restriction enzyme A acts on all sites of restriction enzyme B, but B only acts on (number) sites of A. Double digestion gives me (number) fragments. Explain.
I have no idea what this question means, how to do it, why I'm doing it, what it means. 

Fourth question: I am given the DNA fingerprints of a child and two couples. Now have to work out which couple the child belongs to. I have gone down along the electrophoresis gel results and given each fragment a letter. Then I made a table of which parents have which allele comparing this to the child's alleles. Then which ever couple can give the child the specific combination of alleles is the child's parent. Correct?

Fifth question: I digest a DNA fragment with two separate restriction enzymes, then do a double digest and get the electrophoresis results. Now I have to make a restriction map, of the piece of DNA. I know this is basically a logic puzzle, but I can't seem to wrap my head around finding the correct restriction map. Help!? How do I go about finding it?

Sixth question: Basically another restriction map, but this time with a bacterial plasmid and I only use one restriction enzyme, but for different digestion times which gives me different electrophoresis results for each time period. Now what? This one confuses me even more than the last one. I originially thought that I should just take the electrophoresis results of the longest digestion time and use this to make my restriction map. The size of the fragments in the longest digestion time do add up to the total size of the piece of DNA, so is it that simple?

Seventh question: I am given the size of a haploid genome in bp. Now I have to work out how many phage vectors carrying xkb DNA fragments would give a full genomic library, in a ideally theoretically situation (I am given x). Then I have to work out how many vectors should be used to ensure every sequence has a 95% chance of being included in the library. I have no idea what to do here. 
I now have to do this again but with a YAC and again I'm given the fragment size the YAC can ""hold"".

162,Looking for advice for undergraduate program.,"So at the end of this upcoming school year I should have an Associate's Degree in molecular biology, and I will be turning 30.

I am now going through the process of selecting a school and a program where I hope to spend another 2 years earning my undergraduate B.Sc. degree.

I am hoping to get some opinions and perspectives on which school/program may be the wisest choice.

My absolute first love is reptiles, primarily foreign, exotic, and often venomous species. That said, living in Canada, I'm not too optimistic on the local job market for herpetologists.

Of course my passion is not for just reptiles, I admire all wildlife, and would happily devote my life to wildlife biology. Which I find to be a touch more realistic, and think that living in British Columbia, Canada, may allow me some exceptional employment opportunities.

As a Vancouverite, my main two options for University are Simon Fraser, and University of British Columbia.

I had originally intended to attend the Applied Animal Biology Program at UBC, but I am starting to think that completing a specified biology program would ultimately close more doors for me than if I completed a  more generalized program, such as the B.Sc. in Biological Sciences offered by SFU.

I'm of the mind that both degrees would permit me a biology oriented career with animals, however, if the job market becomes further restricted, my Biological Sciences degree may allow me to work in Conservation, or Ecology, whereas my Applied Animal degree would not.

Is there any truth to this?

As it stands, I understand the prospects look bleek for bio undergrads, and am contemplating a M.Sc., but I must also consider my age as I will likely be 32 by the time I obtain my undergrad.

So any advice on what program may be best?

So far, I'm looking at:

Applied Animal Biology (UBC)
Biology (UBC)
Natural Resource Conservation (UBC)
Zoology (UBC Okanagan)
Applied Biology (SFU)
Biological Sciences (SFU)

177,Question on AP Biology Lab,"Hey guys!
I have a quick question about diffusion and osmosis. For our lab, we have to create models of living cells using dialysis tubing. We will be using four solutions. All these solutions will have one dialysis tube in it with one substance, and a separate substance will be outside in the beaker the tubing will be sitting in. The four substances are 1 M sucrose, 1M glucose, 5% ovalbumin, and 1M NaCl. My question is this: I have to set up these materials in such a way to determine their diffusion rates. My first thought was to have every substance in glucose since it is a monosaccharide and could easily diffuse through the tubing, and for the glucose for have it sit in ovalbumin, since the protein will be too bid to travel through the holes. But, I'm not sure I'm taking the right route.

It's not an extended essay per se, but it's the closest thing to what we could find that resembles what we're doing.

This task spans across the entire school year.

As I said, we're very interested in virus and bacteria and wish to conduct research on antibiotic resistant organisms, current methods of treatment, methods in development and the nature of anitbiotic resistance organisms, how they achieve resistance etc. The thing is though, we're not supposed to simply read books about it and look up information regarding this. We're supposed to do our own research, conduct experiments... something that requires us to go out in the world and do our own thing. That's where we need your help, **are there any good experiments you can do relating to our subject?** Should we grow our own bacteria or something along those lines? Do you have any other tips that'd help us? Perhaps you think there's an even better and more exciting topic to work with? Please share!

I am very, very excited about this, because I strongly believe that computer literacy is empowering. (I taught programming for 5 years.)

However, I am not a biologist. I have never taken any biology classes. I do not work with biologists. I know nothing about biology. Before this job fell into my lap, I did not even think about biology.

My degree is in computational physics, and I need your help to understand how to do my job well. Let me be very clear: I am not trying to turn biology students into computer scientists or physicists. I am trying to understand the specific ways in which programming skills can help biologists, and how to give biology students those skills.

How do practicing biologists use programming/simulation/modeling/computers in their work? How could they? How will they, in the future?

Does lack of programming ability negatively impact people working in this discipline? How would a biologist who had a strong programming background benefit?

What topics in the undergraduate biology curriculum do you foresee as being the most/least difficult to integrate programming into? Why? How would you address these issues?

I think it is fair to say that people who study biology do so because it is what is exciting/interesting to them, not because they are excited by programming. How would you motivate biology students to become engaged in programming?

Many people who earn a BSc in biology go on to work in another field. How can biologists who continue into those fields benefit from programming skills?

Little did the new owners know that after about a year or so raccoons are no longer safe animals to keep as pets, as they begin to bite and attack their owners. 

Once the realization was made by the owners that these animals were no longer safe to keep in the house, they replicated the ending of the beloved cartoon series and released the animals in to the forest, where the racoons thrived. Being aliens to this environment and having no natural enemies in China, the animals went unchecked for decades. 

Ancient Chinese temples erected throughout the Chinese wilderness have become homes to these pests, and they have reportedly done nearly 30 million USD worth of damage to these ancient structures in the past few decades, with little success in slowing them down.

My thoughts so far are that the genes are all, or some of them, X-linked plus that some combination of them is lethal... But while that might explain the first two cross results somehow... it doesn't explain all the missing combinations.

300,PCR product wont stay in wells while loading,"I have a couple PCR reactions that wont stay in the well of the gel. When I say it wont stay in the gel, I mean as soon as I start pipetting, the mixture starts rising to the surface. Once it hits the surface, it quickly spreads out.

I mixed them with the usual amount of loading buffer I made myself, and as a check mixed them with a pre-made version as well. The problem persists.

I then raised the concentration of the loading buffer. Nope. The wells were completely covered with TAE. The TAE is fresh from today, and was used before me with success. Additionally, if I mix the loading buffer with water, the solution loads perfectly. So it's definitely a problem with the PCR mix.

The DNA is not from a mini-prep, just a direct digest, so excess ethanol should not be a problem. Also, I added the DNA I used to some water, and loaded that with the appropriate amount of loading buffer without a problem. 

This happened across multiple primer sets. I doubt all of them are contaminated with something. PCR buffer, nucleotides, and Taq have all worked previously and are relatively new. I've done these reactions hundreds of times, and its not a problem with my pipetting technique (not too deep, not to shallow, and not contacting the walls of the well.)

Honestly I'm about to set up the reaction again with new reagents and it's not time sensitive to get this PCR done but I was wondering if there is anybody out there who has experienced the same problem.

304,Biology needs mathematical theories,"The reason I'm bringing this topic up is because among my classmates and professors(I'm studying Biological Engineering), there's almost an indifference(approaching hatred) to math. I personally love math and it is my opinion that math crucial if real advancements need to be made in the field of Biology. I'd love to hear what you guys think of my arguments!

There are very few quantitative theories in Biology, that have any sort of predictive power. However, we need to think of ways to model organisms and their behavior, biological molecules and their behavior using existing or new math. I believe this is important because engineering and biology are intersecting a lot more nowadays. Engineering anything new and innovative requires solid theory. Imagine building an airplane without knowing the aerodynamic laws and the mathematics behind them. 

Currently, there is no theory that predicts protein function or organism behavior. A theory/mathematical equation/computer program that can predict protein function based on sequence would be the equivalent of Newton's laws to Biology. Biology might have its equivalent to Newton's laws in the theory of evolution, but evolution's predictive powers pale in comparison to theories in physics. 

The standard argument against building models and theories in biology is that biological systems are complex, multi-causal and messy. Of course, the beauty of a cell lies in its complexity rather than its simplicity. However, this beauty can't be lost because of mathematical equations now can it?

""S phase is part of interphase. Replication of the genetic material is separated, in time, from the partitioning of chromosome copies during M phase.""

Is it saying replicated genetic material is seperated during the G2 phase? Or is it saying that there is a time gap between when chromosomes are replicated and when the cell splits. Also, what does it mean exactly by the ""partitioning of chromosomes""? 

I understand what partitioning means in the sense of computers, but Biology seems different. The text doesn't explain when the chromosome exactly splits (I read very carefully, believe me), and along what boundaries. If I'm right, the sister chromatids stay together, forming a chromosome, which is separated from the other 2 sister chromatids on the opposite side of the illustration, and each side goes into the separate daughter cells?

Also, when the cell separates, or whenever, does the uncoiled chromosome ever coil back together? Also, is the DNA still wrapped around the chromatin when this uncoiling happens?

Last quarter, I discovered programming while taking a class that teaches how to model basic biological processes in R, and although it's one of the hardest things I've ever had to learn, I took a liking to it. 

I've been learning on my own with resources like [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/gc/), [Python for Bioinformatics](http://www.amazon.com/Bioinformatics-Programming-Using-Python-Biological/dp/059615450X), and the [Biopython documentation](http://biopython.org/), but I feel that without the structure and background that a university course gives, I am floundering in the dark. I see a lot of bioinformaticians whose backgrounds are primarily CS, but who’ve learned enough biology to be able to get by in their respective fields. I feel as though this disadvantages me, since I see most of the heavy lifting as being in the programming side, as opposed to the theoretical side. 

Also, I have zero interest in bioinformatics, as poring over genomic and proteomic data bores me. Instead, I want to apply computing concepts to ecology, like evolution and population dynamics. However, I've been learning with bioinformatics resources because I see a great deal of overlap in just the concepts alone.

411,Mycotoxins re: mold,"Let me know if this isn't the appropriate subreddit. I would post in /r/askdocs, but I want someone with a knowledge of mycotoxins as opposed to health/medicine.  

I'm moving from an apartment with a mold problem and I'm trying to figure out the issue of mycotoxins. Unfortunately, I'm having a hard time differentiating between legitimate science and pseudo-science/alternative science. It seems like a lot of the online literature bounces back between the two. They're real and have negative effects, but most articles pertaining to treatment are from sites like mercola.com or advocate stuff like anti-candida diets. I know nothing about biology.

If there are any experts here, I would really appreciate your expertise with some questions: 

1) Is there any way to kill mycotoxins on materials, either porous or non-porous? 

1.5) Is this something I should actually be concerned about?

2) Is there any way to kill mycotoxins in your body? Are mycotoxins in the body even a significant concern? Should I have myself tested for them? 

3) If removed from an environment with mycotoxins, are mycotoxins in the body/on material still very hazardous? 

4) Do carbon air filters actually kill mycotoxins? 

5) What health effects could mycotoxins actually have? I'm having a hard time figuring out whats hyperbole. 

6) When I move to a new apartment, do I have to trash all my belongings to avoid the spread of mycotoxins or is this ridiculous? 

The last question, I'm very confused about. I keep reading that you can transfer mycotoxins to new environments if you bring your infested belongings. However, before I knew I was dealing with a mold  problem, I was taking transit, going to friend's houses, going to work, etc. If this is that easily transferable, shouldn't all of these places be infested by now? Why aren't mycotoxin infestations everywhere, since presumably many people have this problem and since they are apparently hard to kill and easy to transfer? If they are almost impossible to kill, wouldn't they be laying dormant in used books, used clothing, used appliances, etc? And yet, they aren't considered a concern when purchasing any of these things.

Enterlein S, Warfield KL, Swenson DL, Stein DA, Smith JL, Gamble CS, Kroeker AD, Iversen PL, Bavari S, Muhlberger E. VP35 Knockdown Inhibits Ebola Virus Amplification and Protects against Lethal Infection in Mice. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2006 Mar;50(3):984-93.

Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) are a class of uncharged single-stranded DNA analogs modified such that each subunit includes a phosphorodiamidate linkage and morpholine ring. PMO antisense agents have been reported to effectively interfere with the replication of several positive-strand RNA viruses in cell culture. The filoviruses, Marburg virus and Ebola virus (EBOV), are negative-strand RNA viruses that cause up to 90% lethality in human outbreaks. There is currently no commercially available vaccine or efficacious therapeutic for any filovirus. In this study, PMO conjugated to arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide (P-PMO) and nonconjugated PMO were assayed for the ability to inhibit EBOV infection in cell culture and in a mouse model of lethal EBOV infection. A 22-mer P-PMO designed to base pair with the translation start site region of EBOV VP35 positive-sense RNA generated sequence-specific and time- and dose-dependent inhibition of EBOV amplification in cell culture. The same oligomer provided complete protection to mice when administered before or after an otherwise lethal infection of EBOV. A corresponding nonconjugated PMO, as well as nonconjugated truncated versions of 16 and 19 base residues, provided length-dependent protection to mice when administered prophylactically. Together, these data suggest that antisense PMO and P-PMO have the potential to control EBOV infection and are promising therapeutic candidates.

The filoviruses Marburg virus and Ebola virus (EBOV) quickly outpace host immune responses and cause hemorrhagic fever, resulting in case fatality rates as high as 90% in humans and nearly 100% in nonhuman primates. The development of an effective therapeutic for EBOV is a daunting public health challenge and is hampered by a paucity of knowledge regarding filovirus pathogenesis. This report describes a successful strategy for interfering with EBOV infection using antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs). A combination of EBOV-specific PMOs targeting sequences of viral mRNAs for the viral proteins (VPs) VP24, VP35, and RNA polymerase L protected rodents in both pre- and post-exposure therapeutic regimens. In a prophylactic proof-of-principal trial, the PMOs also protected 75% of rhesus macaques from lethal EBOV infection. The work described here may contribute to development of designer, \""druggable\"" countermeasures for filoviruses and other microbial pathogens.

Budding of Ebola virus (EBOV) particles from the plasma membrane of infected cells requires viral and host proteins. EBOV virus matrix protein VP40 recruits TSG101, an ESCRT-1 (host cell endosomal sorting complex required for transport-1) complex protein in the vacuolar protein sorting (vps) pathway, to the plasma membrane during budding. Involvement of other vps proteins in EBOV budding has not been established. Therefore, we used VP40 deletion analysis, virus-like particle-release assays, and confocal microscopy to investigate the potential role of ESCRT-1 proteins VPS4, VPS28, and VPS37B in EBOV budding. We found that VP40 could redirect each protein from endosomes to the cell surface independently of TSG101 interaction. A lack of VPS4 adenosine triphosphatase activity reduced budding by up to 80%. Inhibition of VPS4 gene expression by use of phosphorodiamidite morpholino antisense oligonucleotides protected mice from lethal EBOV infection. These data show that EBOV can use vps proteins independently of TSG101 for budding and reveal VPS4 as a potential target for filovirus therapeutics.

Chemical modifications of antisense morpholino oligomers enhance their efficacy against ebolavirus infection. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Feb 17. [Epub ahead of print].

Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) are uncharged nucleic acid-like molecules designed to inactivate specific gene expression via antisense-based steric hindrance of mRNA translation. PMOs have been successful in knockdown of viral gene expression and replication in the case of acute viral infections in animal models and are well tolerated in human clinical trials. We propose that antisense PMOs represent a promising class of therapeutic agents to combat filoviral infections. Previously we have shown that mice treated with a PMO complementary to a region spanning the start codon of VP24 mRNA were protected against lethal Ebolavirus challenge. In the present study, we report on the ability of two additional VP24-specific PMOs to reduce cell-free translation of a VP24 reporter, to inhibit in vitro replication of Ebolavirus, and to protect mice against lethal challenge when delivered prior to infection. Additionally, structure-activity relationship evaluations were conducted to assess enhancement of antiviral efficacy associated with PMO chemical modifications that included conjugation with peptides of variable length and composition, positioning of conjugated peptides to either the 5' or 3' terminus, and charge modifications conferred by addition of piperazine moieties. Conjugation with arginine-rich peptides greatly enhanced the antiviral efficacy of VP24-specific PMOs in infected cells and in mice during lethal Ebolavirus challenge.

There are no currently approved treatments for filovirus infections. In this study we report the discovery process which led to the development of antisense Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers (PMOs) AVI-6002 (composed of AVI-7357 and AVI-7539) and AVI-6003 (composed of AVI-7287 and AVI-7288) targeting Ebola virus and Marburg virus respectively. The discovery process involved identification of optimal transcript binding sites for PMO based RNA-therapeutics followed by screening for effective viral gene target in mouse and guinea pig models utilizing adapted viral isolates. An evolution of chemical modifications were tested, beginning with simple Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers (PMO) transitioning to cell penetrating peptide conjugated PMOs (PPMO) and ending with PMOplus containing a limited number of positively charged linkages in the PMO structure. The initial lead compounds were combinations of two agents targeting separate genes. In the final analysis, a single agent for treatment of each virus was selected, AVI-7537 targeting the VP24 gene of Ebola virus and AVI-7288 targeting NP of Marburg virus, and are now progressing into late stage clinical development as the optimal therapeutic candidates.

Safety and Pharmacokinetic Profiles of Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers with Activity against Ebola Virus and Marburg Virus: Results of Two Single Ascending Dose Studies.  Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014 Aug 25. pii: AAC.03442-14. [Epub ahead of print]

Two identical single ascending dose (SAD) studies evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AVI-6002 and AVI-6003, two experimental combinations of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers with positive charges (PMOplus®) that target viral messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding Ebola virus and Marburg virus proteins, respectively. Both AVI-6002 and AVI-6003 were found to suppress disease in virus-infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) in previous studies. AVI-6002 (a combination of AVI-7537 and AVI-7539) or AVI-6003 (a combination of AVI-7287 and AVI-7288) were administered as sequential intravenous (IV) infusions of a 1:1 fixed dose ratio of the two subcomponents. In each study, 30 healthy male and female subjects between 18 and 50 years of age were enrolled in 6 dose escalation cohorts of 5 subjects each and received a single IV infusion of active study drug (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 1.5, 3, and 4.5 mg/kg per component) or placebo in a 4:1 ratio. Both AVI-6002 and AVI-6003 were safe and well tolerated at the doses studied. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not observed in either study. The four chemically similar PMOplus components exhibited generally similar PK profiles. The mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration curve (AUC) values of the four components exhibited dose-proportional PK. The estimated plasma half-life of all four components was 2 to 5 hours. The safety of the two combinations and the PK of the four components were similar, regardless of the target RNA sequence.

Development of novel strategies targeting the highly virulent ebolaviruses is urgently required. A proteomic study identified the ER chaperone HSPA5 as an ebolavirus-associated host protein. Here, we show using the HSPA5 inhibitor (-)- epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) that the chaperone is essential for virus infection, thereby demonstrating a functional significance for the association. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo gene targeting impaired viral replication and protected animals in a lethal infection model. These findings demonstrate that HSPA5 is vital for replication and can serve as a viable target for the design of host-based countermeasures.

This is officially my first post, but I am interested to know what you all think about this and some interesting discussion. Today, I watched this video ( http://tiny.cc/bo8wlx ) that was published by the Jane Goodall Institute. In the video, Jane makes a comment that a business (and presumably more businesses) is beginning to consider trees (and thereby biodiverstiy) as assets on their balance sheets directly. Her point is that in doing so, this business is moving the converstaion towards ecosystem valutaion within a conservation framework rather than continuing down the path of conserving ecosystems services for utilitarian uses. My concern, and overall question to you all is, could these assets be liquidated if said company(ies) were to be taken over or declare bankrupticy? Could these trees that they are trying to preserve within the framework of investments, be chopped down simply to pay off possible future debts? What are some different ways that these trees could be classified so that they are no longer 'consumable goods' to be tradede like stocks, but some sort of 'beneficent goods' (made that term up on the fly) that are legally protected from destruction and are allowed to continue providing habitat and carbon sequestration, among a myriad of other things.

I've been working on cloning a gene into pET-22b for ages and keep having issues. Here's a picture of today's issue:

http://i.imgur.com/SjkbKSn.jpg

My lanes are as follows: 

1. 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder

2. Undigested (circular) pET-22b

3. Single-cut pET-22b (NdeI)

4. Single-cut pET-22b (XhoI)

5 - 7. Double-cut pET-22b (NdeI, XhoI)

First, to give some info: I cut out the bands that I assumed were double-digested DNA in lanes 5 - 7, which is why there's a black region. I ran the gel at 100V for a few hours in 1x TAE in a large 1% gel for higher resolution, which seemed to work, but my banding patterns are ridiculous. I assume that I have a mixture of supercoiled and dimerised plasmid in lane two, which is fine. But what in the world would cause the smearing and ""sad face"" pattern in lanes 3 - 7? Note that all of the DNA besides the ladder was dissolved in 1x Cutsmart buffer from NEB for the digestions (my uncut DNA was in there just to ensure that the buffer wouldn't affect how the DNA ran to a great extent). Also, I'm using SYBR green rather than EtBr for visualisation, and our imager isn't particularly great which is why the exposure is so low.

623,ELI5:Gamma motor neurons and intrafusal muscle fibers,"This is what the professor said word for word. It's confusing me. Please ELI5 how gamma motor neurons work in voluntary movement

&gt;There are descending influences in the brain. The brain is what is controlling the voluntary movements. Reflexes are not really directly involved. There are small motor neurons down in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and they are called gamma motor neurons because they’re axons are in the gamma range. And they’re driven only by descending inputs from brain. There are no reflex connections to the gamma motor neurons. They don’t have primary afferent inputs. They get all of their input from descending connections form brain. What happens when they’re activated, they cause contraction of the intrafusal muscle fibers. Remember those intrafusal muscle fibers have contractile elements on their ends. You can see them here in the intrafusal muscle fibers (3 candy cane looking parts of the intrafusal muscle fibers). The ends are short. Gamma motor neuron axons come in to activate the contractile ends of the intrafusal muscle fibers. What’s going to happen? Not much tension because the ends are smaller compared to the bundle of extrafusal muscle fiber. They are huge and intrafusal muscles are small. Contractions of the ends of the intrafusal muscle fibers produce almost no tension at all on the bone. But what they do is pull on the center part of the spindle because we haven’t change the length of the extrafusal fibers. Only the intrafusal fibers were changed so the center part of the spindle has to get lengthened. That has the same effect as stretching the muscle. Stretch the whole muscle to lengthen the spindle and cause 1a to fire. If you fire the gamma motor neuron alone, then it stretches the center part of the spindle afferent because the ends of the intrafusal muscle fiber are short. So that activates the group 1a and group 2 afferent fibers and its job is to regulate the sensitivity of the stretch reflex during voluntary movement.

&gt;When your arm is straight, you want the stretch reflex to work just as much as when your arm is flexed. But if there were gamma afferents, the spindle fibers would be stretched far in straight arm position. When you contract and flex, the spindle receptors would not stretch that much. The intrafusal fibers change in length would be squashed by contracting the bicep. If working properly and are extended and then flex the limb, they’re going to get squashed unless they shorten. In order to do so, the gamma motor neurons fire during the voluntary movement and those gamma motor neurons make that spindle sensitive even though the body of the muscle is short.

I think I understand most of the first paragraph - gamma motor neurons get input from the brain because it wants to do some voluntary movement. GMN cause intrafusal fiber ends to shorten which kind of stretches the spindle centers so it's as if it were sensing the muscle was stretched. This causes the 1a and II fibers to fire like in the stretch reflex (?) so there is a reflexive shortening. But what does it have to do with regulating sensitivity?

The second paragraph makes no sense to me at all.

Please halp

Edit: Rereading the second paragraph this is what I get from it -  if extrafusal fibers are short, the spindle is squished so it wont feel a stretch and wont activate 1a fibers for the reflex. So when our body voluntarily shortens a muscle, it also fires GMN to shorten the spindle so it's taut enough to sense any stretch (and vice versa)",biology,1410730909,[deleted],0,2,True,2014-09-14

794,Questions about a home-made positive pressure glovebox!,"I plan on building a glovebox that is capable of maintaining positive pressure via a computer fan that pulls air through a HEPA filter into the chamber. A small vent on the other side of the chamber will be open while the computer fan is running to allow the fresh air and vapors from whatever I am working on to escape. I would also like to make an antechamber if I am crafty enough to finish the main chamber in a timely manner.

I'll mainly be working with biological material that is prone to contamination which is why I would really like the chamber to be positively pressurized. I am using 7 sheets of 18"" x 24"" acrylic glass for the chamber and silicon caulk to hold it together. So my questions are...

1) Will a computer fan like the one below be strong enough to pull air through a HEPA filter? I was thinking about using a filter from a respirator if a computer fan won't sufficiently pull air through a regular filter. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054S92FW/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A1JDVQBTNMED4K

2) Does it seem unnecessary to have positive pressure instead of still air?

3) Will the turbulence from the fresh air coming in complicate things or make it considerably more difficult to work in?

4) I know HEPA filters are great, but is having a steady supply of air blowing in over biological materials less risky than taking my chances with a still air box?

836,Friend says not to waste my time getting a PhD in Evolutionary Biology. What should I do?,"I have a friend who insists that getting a PhD in Evolutionary Biology is the worst mistake I can make. 

I am very worried about my parents' health and financial situation, so I need to make sure I choose a secure career path that will provide me with the salary necessary to support them. 

Evolutionary biology research seems to be the most interesting career path for me (I have had 3 years of research experience in bioinformatics), but my friend is strongly urging me to go to medical school.

Some of his reasons:

- Funding is very low as of right now for science.

- We are peaking as far as discoveries go in science. 

- He said that we have all of these scientists at multiple universities with access to more resources than the past, yet not a lot of major breakthroughs have been made. 

- The major discoveries have already been discovered by those in the past (Rosalind Franklin, Watson and Crick, Einstein, Newton etc).

- Biotech companies are not doing too hot right now also because of number of things left to innovate for profit are almost gone. You either have to reinvent the wheel or make something no one has. 

- The most secure job in the market right now is a doctor. He pointed out that if I want job security and a big salary, the best option for me right now is to go to medical school and specialize

- a single professor ends up having multiple PhD students, the system is built to collapse because there is going to be an overproduction of PhDs

- I can get an MD in the same amount of time or less(assuming I complete prereqs, MCATs, shadowing etc in a 1-2 year time span, then go to med school for 4 years)

- I am guaranteed a job after getting my MD, then completing a residency AND I can still do research if I want to.


What should I do? 

I know what I need to do in order to get into medical school, but it definitely is a long path.  

So is getting a PhD, but evolutionary biology seems more interesting to me and sick people make me very depressed.

My friend is strongly urging me to start working for medical school because even becoming an accountant, engineer, industry researcher etc isn't secure anymore due to layoffs and the economy. 

He said that doctors will always be in demand even after the economy collapses because people will always be sick. 

I really don't know what to do, I am very afraid of what the future holds and I am leaning towards the medical school route in order to take care of my parents, but I know that will be the very stressful path.",biology,1411861336,[deleted],90,52,True,2014-09-27

Interdisciplinary work is particularly fruitful within the same level of investigation (Cultural evolution modeling applied to economic questions; computational methods applied to sociology; cultural anthropology blending with psych; etc.) but hits a bit of a wall when it comes to different levels of investigation.

Thoughts?,"A bit of background: I am currently a senior biology major concentrating in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at a respectable university. I have conducted research/field work for 2.5 years now and plan to finish up with an Honor's thesis written on an experiment I designed and implemented. I do enjoy research and so would like to pursue a PhD in avian Ecology, Behavior, or Evolutionary biology, but don't yet feel ready to take the plunge into graduate school. 

Having worked as a field tech for 3 summers already, I have met many grad students and grad school hopefuls who were using those temporary, seasonal jobs as ways to gain experience. I can definitely see the benefit of staying closer to my interests (research and ornithology) as well as the benefit of gaining practical experience for my grad-school application. 

A reason why I dislike the idea of hopping between field jobs during my gap-year(s) is the simple fact that I would rather not be forced to completely uproot my life every 3-4 months chasing the next job, and would rather settle down for a bit. I would also like to live in a bigger city (my college town is small and tucked away in upstate NY). 

Trying to decide what kind of jobs I *would* enjoy, I immediately thought of zoo-keeping (or being a technician at a wildlife/rehab center, etc). For four years in high school I volunteered at a zoological garden/aquarium, and really enjoyed practicing animal husbandry while being able to educate the public through outreach. I also spent time my freshman and sophomore years of college working at the Raptor facility at my school. For these reasons I would like to look into getting a job as an avian keeper at a zoo, but am worried that if I go this route, while my peers continue with research, etc, I will make myself less competitive in the end.

During this summer I was part of a undergraduate research program funded by the USDA. Because the USDA was the primary funder, we had to pick a lab that does work that is agriculturally or environmentally related. Because of this I ended up picking a professor of ecology. 

Well the program has ended and I had a great time, despite the research not necessarily being what I'd ideally want to work on (I'd really like to see what medical research is like), but I can't decide whether or not I should continue working in his lab. He has already offered to write me a letter of recommendation, however I feel that one benefit of remaining in his lab would be being able to get a much stronger letter. 

I also feel somewhat bad about just downright leaving as soon as the program ends. I fear that might upset him. However I also feel like the research I'm doing in his lab is not really pertinent to the type of medical research I would like doing.

I looked at MSDS for it and the two I looked up don't display mutagenic or carcinogenic effects. I'm guessing it's because the tests were done on bacteria. Then apparently it's used to treat cancer in cows.

Really wish there was a safer alternative, and the ones I've read about are apparently not that safe either, or actually more dangerous. The one I was using was already in liquid form so I guess that's better, I heard there are powdered forms that can get dust everywhere.

I am new to PCR, but I've been scrambling to understand as much as I can. I don't personally know any experts on this subject, I need an adult...
Here's what was handed off to me: 

A primer pair was screened against negative and positive material, it showed  clear separation on software analysis. Positive material showed non specific amplification, negative material amplified with dual peaks. No other primer pairs tested showed separation of material.

I can't replicate this data, exactly. My bosses know little to nothing about qPCR. I have used old and fresh primer working stocks (2uM/uL F+R, testing final concentrations from 100-400nM). Used old and fresh stock of appropriately quantified DNA (~25ng/uL). MgCl2 concentration tests from 1-5mM. 
Amplification settings are really where I'm left with anything to try. I've copied the original method with mixed results. These primers are F-57.7 Tm, 45%GC and R- 60 Tm, 55%GC. Product length 193bp.
It looks like my coworker had been using a kind of ""touch-up"" setting. Ramping from 54 -&gt;57 annealing temp, 12 second steps. Normally I know a ""touchdown"" is preferred to avoid mispriming.
Most of my latest attempts have resulted in only non specific amplification, across the board.

Should I try reaching more towards the lower temperature, touch-up? I ran a gel to confirm that the few products I have seen were legitimately ~193bp. I just don't understand why it seems so difficult to get a proper amplification when I know it's already been done.

I've been told the conference accepts everyone that submits abstracts and that I shouldn't worry much about what to put in my abstract. I am in evolutionary biology.



The problem is, I don't really have results for either project yet. I have preliminary results that don't really point to a conclusion. Data collection for both projects is done, I just have 3 months to get results that mean something. Problem is, I don't know if such results exists. The deadline is this week. Both of my PI's (the two projects come from different labs) happen to be out of town this week and can't help me with analysis. I can figure out part of it, but my analysis skills aren't very advanced so I am limited with what preliminary results I can get out of my data set.


I am applying to PhD programs following this conference, so I want to present my research to possible PI's at other schools. My problem is, what if I submit an abstract now, but one or both projects end up not having any significant results? Then I am in an embarrasing situation where I have to back out of presenting. Or I could just attend the conference and not present, but that doesn't sound very impressive to a potential PI right when I'm about to apply, now does it?
I am at a loss for what to do.

However around 90 degrees nothing happened. When we added the drops of iodine in the beaker of hot water (90 degrees) it started to disappear and it would turn the water yellow like it did at lower temperatures.

73,What are some genomic approaches to studying convergent evolution?,"I'm trying to write a proposal that looks at convergent evolution of complex social cognition and behavior. The organisms I have in mind are bottlenose dolphins, humans, and elephants (all with big brains, convoluted cortices, and spindle neurons) and potentially crows or rats (smooth cortex, no known spindle neurons). I don't have to use all of these organisms and can use others (such as out-groups or comparisons).


My main question is whether complex social behavior is rooted in the oxytocinergic systems (or equivalent) of these species, having evolved beyond parent/offspring interactions. Or, in general, genetic similarities exclusive to these species that involve or correlate with encephalization/oxytocin receptors/social behavior and shed light on the context in which they may have evolved. Crows have language, imitation, communication and memory abilities comparable to the highly encephalized species, which means big convoluted brains aren't necessarily required for complex social cognition.


Genetics jargon is way over my head, but I'm in too deep to change my general idea and don't know of any other evolutionary approaches to the question. If anyone could offer insight as to some possible valid genomic (or other!) approaches to this question and/or explain them to me like I'm 5, it would really help me out a lot! 


**Particularly how to assume:**

* **Selection on certain traits/gene regions**

* **Convergent evolution**

* **Evolutionary/environmental context**

I'm having a hard time interpreting/believing the results we got, and beginning to question our assay procedure. As implied in the title, we used CellTracker Green to determine cell viability. As I understand it, this leaks out of cells when they die due to the loss of membrane integrity. But I'm beginning to see that a common procedure is to have an alternative dye which specifically stains dead cells. So I'm wondering if what we did is at all valid. We only ended up with 1 functional gel filled channel out of 20, and 2 out of 4 functional medium filled controls.

(I'm a sophomore and I need to decide yesterday),"I'm currently a sophomore in college and I'm trying to decide between a Biology major with a specialization in Cellular Molecular and Genetics (CMG) or one in Quantitative Biology. The quantitative bio involves a lot of math and prepares you to make mathematical models out of biological systems while CMG is what it sounds like. 

My issue is that I'm really started to hate memorizing everything I need to for my classes. I'm currently taking Genetics and I really liked the first half of the course where we learned about different inheritance patterns and then applied that knowledge to problems (what likely hood does person B have of inheriting random disease?). However, when it comes to memorizing specific facts about processes, I don't enjoy it. I like to learn in general about the stuff, but when it comes to memorizing specific enzymes I just want to give up. 

I've always liked math, but I'm nervous about committing to it. I enjoyed calc II, and for the quantitative bio I would have to take differential equations, linear algebra, multivariate calc and stats II. 

What I really like about math is the problem solving aspect of it. I was wondering if there were any fields of biology that were more like that/ like the problem solving part of genetics. 

I've been struggling with this decision in part because I'm not entirely sure what I want to do with my life. I think a lot about researching. I only had one experience with for only a week and I didn't really enjoy it. I think it may have been because I was only there for a week and didn't have time to really get comfortable.

109,Young biology student who needs advice from r/biology,"Hello r/biology, 
I apologize for the wall of text, but I would really appreciate it if someone would respond to some of the questions I have.
I am a 3rd year biology major at a large university in the southeastern United States and I will be graduating a year from now (hopefully with a minor in entomology). My science GPA is a 3.80, overall 3.93, if that even matters, and I study like I’m going to med school (OK, maybe not THAT hard). I have enjoyed learning about the natural world since I was very young, and have wanted to become a biologist since I was 8. So far, I still want to become one, but I’m not sure yet what field to specialize in. It has been my goal to go into research and discover cool new things about ecosystems, organisms and biological solutions to people problems. At least, that is what I tell people. However, I have many worries about the future (what adolescent doesn’t). 

Since starting my undergraduate experience, I have sought out research labs to get a feel for the academic environment. I volunteered and worked two years in a forestry lab, helping a PhD student phenotype wood cores, and trying to be as involved as possible in the creative process of streamlining data collection, as well as data analysis. Currently I am volunteering in an ecology lab, looking at the ecology of tree epiphytes, after having decided forestry/forest resource management is interesting but maybe not something I want to do.

First of all, I am not sure what field I want to go into. I like entomology, mostly because bugs are easy to use/manipulate, but also because they are really cool. I like thinking about community ecology, population dynamics, solutions to problems in pest management, but also evolution and organismal ecology and behavior. What kind of thought process do I need to have to work out what I should focus on? Do I need to know yet? Does it even matter? I assume it is based on connections that you gain while working as an undergrad, that turn into internships, etc.

Second, the field of academic research scares me. I hear from people that it is a competitive, sink –or-swim part of academia. That being said, I get mixed signals for my PIs and professors. While they work hard, a lot of them have a very laid back way of approaching life and they seem happy doing their thing. As someone going to graduate school and beyond, what should I expect from starting out as a lowly graduate student? Obviously nobody starts out with tenure at a big name university, so what is life like, as a grad student doing research in prairie grass ecology (for example). Can a PhD student sustain himself and maybe a family? Or are you a stressed out sexless wreck like those medical students I keep reading about over at r/medicine. I don’t expect this to be the case, but you never know.

Third, for some reason I am very anal about things like data, and how it is collected. For example, when phenotyping wood cores, the x-ray images are very grainy, and identifying resin canals is hard. Sometimes you have to make a call and say ‘yes, I’m counting that as one’. How do you justify your research when data is collected that is so subjective. I mean I’ve heard the phrase ‘science is triangulating over multiple fallible perspectives’, but for some reason I feel like I’m just sitting there, wasting time, money and brain power. This is part of the reason why I want to probably go and do something more quantitative than assigning mites in tree foliage to a feeding guild based solely on some amateur entomology knowledge (which was the lab I’m currently in).  

So to round up my ramble, a few more questions: 
- What do I do with my life? Seriously though, how did some of you come to be where you are now, and what personal mindset/questions brought you there?

-  Do I need to stop bitching about data, and just get with the phenotyping?

- How do I academia? Seriously, at what point do people start becoming competent at even writing an academic paper, let alone coming up with fantastic ideas for research projects.  I feel like I am in kindergarten learning ABCs compared to people a couple years into their graduate program, writing comprehensively and efficiently. 

- Is it strange to feel humbled and utterly stupid next to people who made the connection between property values on the northeastern coast and snail-eating crabs in salt marshes?

- Where should I Xpost to for maximum response?

tl/dr: need advice, from fellow biologists, on my future.

Pretty please?","I'm currently writing a mock research proposal for my developmental genetics class and was looking for some feedback on it. I think the topic is super interesting and the potential findings would be huge for evolution and gene regulation. Cutting to the chase:

The male-determination system in monotremes (platypus and echidna) is unlike those of any other mammals, reptiles, or birds. Much work has been put into trying to discover the gene or system responsible for testis-development but to no avail. My idea is to sequence the Y chromosomes (all 5 of them), BLASTn against genes that are known or hypothesized to be involved in sex determination in other organisms. Then create probes of the sequences showing the most similarity and FISH to localize them on the chromosomes to determine if they are in regions that are being actively expressed. I would then mutagenize the genes in the embryo and look for defects in reproductive organ development. Verify that a gene is responsible for sex-determination by adding a WT copy into the chromosome to see if it restores the phenotype (i.e. develops gonads normally).

But how impactful was the first mutation in a certain species that allowed it to survive?

For example, when fish developed lung-like structures, it's not like a fish was born with a lung and could breathe on land immediately, and would this mutation to slightly breathe some air actually help it in it's life at the time it lived?

The first question: Given the [tree and distance matrix figure] (http://i.imgur.com/93cU52g.jpg), does the tree match the distance matrix? Now, I believe the answer is no because the node that connects leaves 1 and 2 is different than the node connecting leaves 4 and 5, whereas they should be equal. Am I correct by using this logic?  

The second question: Construct a distance matrix given this [tree](http://i.imgur.com/k18o6rn.jpg), given the tree is drawn to scale. What I'm confused on is that I'm not sure of the distance from leaves 1 to 3. Would it be 7? or 8? Do we include the length of the branch?

I am having somewhat of a crisis now. In past summers, I had a research fellowship and a lab tech position, both at my university. This summer I applied to three different REUs, was rejected by two and the third disbanded after it lost NSF funding.

I was relying on these three opportunities to occupy my summer. However, as of now, I have no plans. I was thinking of getting a regular job bartending or something of that sort. But the idea of taking a summer away from research is a bit unnerving; people's constant suggestion for me to find an internship outside of my university is not making it any better.

What do you guys think? Is it kosher to take a summer off from bio research, especially so late in my undergrad career? What would you suggest my next step be?

I am assuming that all stipend REU applications are past deadline, and paid internships are obviously much more preferable than unpaid or out-of-pocket.

I was under the impression that R01s were given out for multiple-year funding periods, and while you have to subunit an annual progress report telling them that you've been doing actual work, the money is already benchmarked for your use.


But in looking at this website (http://report.nih.gov/index.aspx) and looking up my PI's R01 history, I see that he has annual ""project numbers"" and each one corresponds to about $300K in a column labeled ""FY Total Cost by IC"". There are nine rows of such entries, which I guess corresponds to the nine years of funding he's received via this R01? What is the point of the annual $300K sum -- can you not spend $400K one year and $200K the following year?


Basically, I would very much appreciate it if someone could explain NIH R01 funding to me. Nobody in my lab knows, and this is a touchy issue for my PI right now, so I'd like to figure it out through alternative channels.

The reason being is, in the book there will have been a virus that mutated the human race into a few new subspecies. So thoughts on the feasibility of that would be good.

One of the new subspecies will have mutated in regards to blood foremost. So I was thinking, what effects would increased blood oxygenation have on the body? I'm thinking effects such as, stamina, ability to handle lower temperatures and such. Also as I'm currently looking up all sorts of avenues on how blood affects the body I'd be glad to hear about all sorts of facts about it.

I would also like to know how feasible it would be for a mutation to increase the effects sunlight have on the body. I mean humans already draw some positive effects from sunlight, such as vitamin D production. Would it be feasible from a biological standpoint for a mutation to alter the body in such a way that the body benefit more from sunlight? Also thoughts on such benefits and possible drawbacks would be awesome.

Since it is fiction I'm okay with these things being not entirely scientific but I want to have to have a scientific basis everything in regards to the subspecies and the book in general.

My group and I had decided to make a plant cell, but with a twist. We play Minecraft, and if you don't know what it is, it is a sandbox build/create game with no limits, just blocks. Some of you may have heard about it but aside the point, we had asked our biology teacher if we could make the plant cell in Minecraft. And with a surprise she had approved! We worked on a daily schedule and tried the best we could, everything was made by hand no program to speed up the building, so that was time consuming as well. We hadn't gone full out but in my opinion we believed it was great.

You can find the plant cell here: http://imgur.com/a/ddhPM

I enjoyed making the plant cell with my buddies but we had decided to go further, and just for fun (we were not graded whatsoever) we made a Minecraft animal cell!

You can find it here:http://imgur.com/a/Afw7u As well as the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF-5VK3pVo8

So I was then contacted by someone who works in Minecraft Education (MinecraftEDU for short) and he was intrigued by my animal cell in Minecraft. So after a short discussion I decided to make DNA in Minecraft and working RNA. Signals, moving blocks, detailed information all that awesome stuff. The map is going to be amazing! It shall supply all 46 chromosomes of a human (23 pairs) and their specific functions. Like the first chromosome codes for what? Eye color, hair color, skin tone?

Now I'm not so sure chromosome pair one will be the same for all humans but what is the average gene in chromosome as well as sister chromatid. That is where I need your help. Please supply me with all the information you know about DNA and RNA but not too complicated because I'm no biologist. 

I just thought that this would be something even more creative than anything I had ever done in the game. I've done my research on DNA and RNA but I want to hear some suggestions from you guys and what you guys may know. Thank you for reading and I can't wait for this map to be completed!

257,Combined Computer Science/Molecular Biology Degrees?,"Hello all,

So over the past 4 years at my university I was able to complete my BS and MS in molecular and cell biology, both with 3.97GPAs. I am currently on the job market right now, but since I am only 22 I really want to further my education. I initially looked into going the PhD route, but realized it was not for me. I loved doing research in college and worked on my own project for 3 years, but I don't think I posses the desire to pursue it further. I am now weighing out my options and came across Bioinformatics/computational biology. I am actually very interested in learning about computer programing in general and could see myself enjoying CS classes. My biggest issue is that no university around me offers Bioinformatics or computational biology. There is a university within driving distance that offers computer science, thus making the added education much cheaper than heading off to a more distant university. Would going back to get a CS degree , combined with my MS in molecular biology, cover all the necessary skills needed for a career in bioinformatics, or would it put me at a disadvantage in the job market?

268,Need opinions regarding PhD vs. MD,"Hello r/Biology!

I am a cell and molecular biology major who is torn with what to do with my future. I initially and still am drawn towards doing academic research. Once I switched majors and colleges within my university, I immediately secured a research position in one of the more well known labs in my college and received a stipend for undertaking a research project. Once finished it will most likely lead to a co-authored publication.  Combing my research experience with my GPA and other extracurricular activities will put me at a competitive edge if I apply to graduate programs. However, I am not sure if that is a wise move with the current academic job outlooks. My understanding (and please someone correct me if I am wrong) is that the current market is abundant with PhD graduates while post-doctorate and academic positions are limited. If that is the case, I do not want to spend 6-10 years working my ass and living below poverty (and most likely in debt) to not secure a job related to my specialty.

With that said I have also been interested in becoming a physician for lower income individuals. I have always enjoyed working with people and seeing the applied aspects of science. Unlike positions in academia (which I could totally be wrong about), there is a current need for physicians and is predicted to increase for at least the next couple of years (someone please correct me if I am wrong regarding this assumption as well). 

If there are current graduate students/professors or medical students reading this, I would really appreciate you opinion! Is the job outlook for PhD's as depressing as I take it to be? What about physician positions? I should also note that I really don't care about the amount of income I could potentially make. I just really want to do something that I can do the rest of my life without dreading to go to work constantly...

272,I'm a high school student and I have some questions...,"Ok, so I am a junior in high school currently, and although I am very interested in computers, biology has really caught my eye as of late. 

Freshman year I took accelerated biology, and the teacher was amazing. She would always explain everything in great detail. From day one I knew that it would be a great class. She seemed very well versed in her area of study and she really inspired me. She even spent 6? months with apes somewhere in Africa during her college years, I forget where or how long, it has been a few years. 

Anyway that is my back story, so here are my questions:

1) I am taking AP biology next year (The same teacher by the way), are there any books I should read or are there any sources that can help prepare me for what is ahead. I have heard it is a very difficult class.

2) I would also like to do biological experiments and simply get involved at home. Problem is although I'm not dirt poor, I don't have a lot of money at my disposal. Earlier today I cracked out a 600X monocular microscope that I got when I was 8 or 9. I haven't used it in 5 years so of course, dust had built up in the weirdest places. I couldn't totally clean it, and after taking a pre-made slide I got with the kit, I couldn't even distinguish what was what with all of the crap in the view. **Wow I am really rambling but for the first portion of number 2 tl;dr It doesn't work.** So anyway, where can I get some decent lab supplies, or what can I do at home? I am interested in making some cultures in agar, but I'm a little clueless where to start. Nothing to advance, just as a proof of concept to satisfy my own curiosity.

3) I plan on majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Biology in college. Would it be more beneficial to double major and/or choose a more specific area of biological study like microbiology or molecular biology? (Are they the same thing?)

I would greatly appreciate any advice you have for me, because I need all the help I can get.",biology,1365821493,grimjr50,21,1,True,2013-04-12

How do I get MrBayes to build the tree using this model?

Im currently a high school senior whos nearly entire high school career has been built off of AP math, hard science classes (chemistry and physics), and engineering courses with some english scattered in there somewhere. Not trying to brag, but after 4 years of it, ive come to hate the nature of hard science, pure math, and plain boring engineering and formulas. Nothing changes in any of it, and i mostly did this attempting to be my brother when i was younger.

I had plans to make a complete 180 for college and pursue psychology, and biology with a minor in german (4 year german student). The only biology classes ive taken was in middle school so it hardly counts, and one honors biology class my freshman year. I remember it fondly and as a kid i have always been interested in organisms (especially sea creatures), and their behaviors and how they are unique. I love science, and especially love the ideas surrounding evolution, always fascinated me. Perhaps its generic but what looks incredible are the people in the discovery shows like Planet Earth that would travel and find new species and observe/learn about them.

I suppose what i really want to know what i should be aware of when i make the switch to biology.

In high school it was mostly memorization with some concepts, but always room to reason. I like when it all fits with reason but not black and white/right and wrong like with all the math in other stuff, and the concepts of advanced chemistry and physics began to be a little much for me. (not saying biology is less advanced, just easier for me to visualize). How difficult are the classes, is it applicable to jobs outside of college,  or just some advice on someone who wants to enter the field.

I appreciate all responses as this huge switch in curriculum scares the crap out of me, and im seeking some advice to calm my mind.

TL;DR: high school senior making switch from hard science/engineering to biology into college looking for some advice on what to expect, or advice to succeed.

EDIT: im very sorry if not referring to biology as a hard science was offensive. My school calls physics and chem hard sciences as they have lots of math, formulas, and pure numbers. Soft sciences are usually geology and biology, at the high school level its mostly memorization with light concepts, i also never took AP Bio, only AP chem and physics, and thats what everyone called them.

359,"Currently an Environmental Science Major, considering switching to Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology... would love some feedback!","Hello all,

I am currently a sophomore majoring in Environmental Science and Resource Management, and I was loving it at first but now as I have began to take a few ""upper level"" courses I'm finding that I'm not really being challenged or learning much of anything new. I'm also finding that Environmental Science is a fallback major for many of my peers because they could not get into the almost non-competitive (requires a 2.5 in intro bio class) biology major at my university, which I feel may negatively impact the way that potential employers view my choice of major. I have recently been looking for undergraduate research and internships related to Environmental Science and I have felt like many people write me off and do not take me seriously... I am fairly confident I have a strong resume (I currently have a great office internship related to the environment), I know I do well in interviews and with speaking to people, and I think am pretty normal when it comes to first impressions (no face tattoos, etc.). 

The only factor that I can really think may be impacting me is my major... thus I am thinking of switching to Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology and using my ESRM credits to get a minor in Environmental Science. This way I could still pursue a similar path towards conservation and resource management, while perhaps having a stronger science focus that would look better in the eyes of potential employers.
I've already talked to an adviser and it is very possible for me to switch majors... but I need to decide and do so this quarter!

So here are my questions for you all... how do you feel employers view Environmental Science majors? How are other Environmental Science majors feeling about their choice of major?

392,Just wanted to share my recent project with you all! For Science! For the Future! For the world!,"I am an undergrad at University of Guam. Inspired by my childhood experience with the JASON project, my friend (a professor at the community college) and I started dreaming up ways to create awesome STEM events on our little island. Around the same time we started our brainstorming, a teacher from one of the local elementary schools contacted my partner and asked if he could help teach her 3rd grade class about microscopy. Starting in 3rd grade, students are expected to test on science standards for 3 different tests, but unfortunately, most primary schools don't have a science classes.
So it began. A year ago, we started creating a group called SIFA (Science is Fun and Awesome). With around a $3000.00 budget, we hand tailored a Science Symposium based off of each individual science standard for the 3rd grade students. Everything was interactive, hands on goodness. We even created a ""field guide"" for the mini scientists to record observations and answer questions in. The students of the Guam Community College hand made biomes, posters and most all of the exhibits. Then they taught the kids everything they needed to know. The teachers from the Elementary school loved it, and even some parents came to see what their kids were learning. Our hope is that this year, there will be a little jump in standardized test scores.
We're in the process of becoming a non-profit. We want to teach teachers, teach students and be complementary to the local Department of Education. We'd love to expand and create a real discovery museum. Eventually, I'd want to expand our services to all of the Pacific region.
I just thought you would enjoy hearing our story; because, like you; I fucking love science. Now maybe a few extra kids will grow up thinking the same thing.  Thanks for taking the time to read about my work, and my dreams.

I'm not completely sure this is the correct sub-reddit for this type of question, if its not please point me in the right direction.

I'm doing a project based around targeted proteomics where by we use isotopically labelled peptide sequences known to be proteotypic to our protein of interest as standards when running a standard LC-MS/MS analysis. This allows us to gain absolute quantification of our peptides of interest given a known amount of the standard is introduces into the analysis. 

I'm currently attempting to pick a standard peptide that is proteotypic to chloroplastic ATP synthase however does not appear in mitochondiral ATP and I'm not having any luck. The idea is that we can have an ATP peptide standard that only shows how much photosynthetic ATP synthase we have in our samples. 

I'm in not really a biologist (technically a chemical oceanographer) and as such I dont think my current approach is the best way of doing thing. I currently take my peptide sequence that has been confirmed as beloning to chloroplastic ATP in our preliminary MS/MS data, BLAST searching it and hoping I find no hits for mitochondrial ATP. 

I've tried to work out, at a peptide level, the difference between chloroplastic ATP and mitochondrial ATP but I'm not having much luck.

Can anyone explain to me the key structural difference between the two forms of ATP so that I could attempt to narrow my search a bit?

549,Is the fossil record a reliable source of evidence for evolution?,"I am part of my school's debate club. It is a Facebook group. Recently, we debated Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. I was in support of evolution. The opposition supported a creationist view of the origin of life. The debate quickly came to the fossil record. He claims that it is not a reliable source of evidence to support evolution as it is so incomplete. These were his exact words:

&gt;*The logic of those who hold the conventional “old age” view would predict that only a small percentage of species has been preserved in the fossil record. Below are the steps in their logic.*

&gt;*First, based on their interpretation of radioisotope dating of fossil-bearing rocks, they believe that animals have existed for the last 600 million “radiometric years.”2*

&gt;*On average, individual animal species appear in only a few layers of the fossil record (covering about 30 million “radiometric years”), and then they disappear. So, according to this way of thinking, all the animal species on earth must have been completely replaced 20 times. (Divide 600 million years total by 30 million years per species group = 20 species groups).*

&gt;*This view would also expect that the number of species alive at any other time was, on average, much less than the 1.3 million alive today—probably around 650,000.3*

&gt;*So by this old-age-based logic, the total number of animal species that have existed in all of earth history is roughly 13 million (650,000 x 20).4 That means only 10% of the species ever to appear on earth still have a living representative, and around 90% are extinct.*

&gt;*Since we have named only about 250,000 fossil species, this line of reasoning predicts that the fossil record has preserved less than 2% of all the species that have ever lived. Different assumptions yield different results, but all estimates agree that if the earth is millions of years old, very, very few of the species of the past have been preserved as fossils.*

&gt;*So, based on the logic of evolutionists, the fossil record is too incomplete to be considered proof. Systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation or experimentation. That is the definition of science.*

The remaining flesh was a bit ""jerky like"" so I have been soaking it in water on and off for the last two days and with soaking it has become apparent there is still a large amount of tissue remaining. Before I start an enzyme/cleaner bath I need to remove as much of the tissue and remaining hide as I can.

1 - What I currently plan to do is the Science Advanced course at the University of UNSW, majoring in Ecology. If marks allow I will go on to complete a Masters in Biological Science. How does this sound?

2 - Where would I go from there? And what should I do during this as well?

3 - I've researched a fair bit online and can't seem to find much useful in regards to what would be a likely career out of this. I've read that education is a common field to branch in to. While I would still enjoy this, I really want to do research. Is this a viable option?

602,Grass DNA extraction trouble,"Hi, I am having a bit of trouble with a genomic DNA extraction and could use some advice in pinpointing the problem(s). 

I have a larger number of grass (C4 tallgrass) samples that I intend to run through reduced-representation sequencing, on the order of 1000, with many more in the future. To handle this large number, I decided to go with Qiagen's 96 DNeasy plant kit. I found out too late however, that the best centrifuge available can induce up to 2250 *g, whereas the protocol recommends much greater force, 5800 *g. I decided to give it a trial run anyway, and doubled the spin times to try to compensate. The filter appeared to be dry after each of the spins. Unfortunately, however, the yield was far lower than hoped (~1.2ng/ml). 

This could obviously be due to the centrifuge issue, or it could be that the bead beating was ineffective during lysis on Qiagen's TissueLyserII. While there was some clear evidence of cellular debris following the neutralization step, there wasn't as much as I am used to from doing bacterial mini-preps, and the leaves of grass still looked fairly intact.

The leaves are also a bit old, collected last August, dried using silica gel beads, and stored in the same.

Any thoughts on whether one, the other, both, or neither of these possible issues are the culprit?

I have this issue I can't find the answer to in any reviews or research papers. (It's quite annoying, really; most reviews appear to somehow gloss over this issue.)

In Drosophila, plants, mosquitoes, whatever, that uses RNAi for both antiviral defense and for gene regulation, the pathways are quite well separated. Different Dicers with different functions serve quite well to separate similar processes. (Exogenous dsRNA gets processed into siRNA by one Dicer and endogenous pre-miRNA gets processed by another.)

So the question is: can we find a similar separation in mammalian systems? After all, there's only one Dicer. Can we block/modulate the siRNA pathway without impacting the miRNA processing in the cell?

(Perhaps by blocking AGO2 specifically; that's my only idea. But what I would like to know if there are other siRNA specific players in this system that I do not know about. Like a binding partner for Dicer that binds to extracellular siRNA and enables Dicer to cleave it -it's just a hypothetical scenario- similarly to R2D2 in Drozi that binds to Dicer2.)

It is quite important question to answer right now because I'm having somewhat contradictory results in the lab, and no one around me seems to have a clue. (It's really annoying: mammalian/bird RNAi people know about development or cancer, but not viruses, mammalian virologist have no clue about RNAi, Drozi/plant people have no clue about mammalian RNAi.)

The way I see it now is that the only reason I'd get PhD is because I'd eventually like to teach or be a PI, but I know that the PI rarely even sets foot in the lab, rather spends his time writing for grants and doing similar paperwork, but I'd like to be actively researching. So in that sense I think it may make more sense to get a masters degree, but I don't want to spend any more money after getting two bachelors degrees, which brings me to another question.

Is it common for people to apply to a PhD program and intentionally leave with a masters instead to avoid having to actually pay for it?

My last test in introductory Microbiology is around the corner. The topics of note include human microflora, the adaptive immune response, and microbial pathogenesis. It can get pretty tedious as many of you know so very well. In the midst of studying the most minute of details, sometimes the big picture pops out at me and it serves as an Ah-Ha moment that keeps me going. 

Today, it was *Coxiella burnetii*. For those of you who are unfamiliar, it's an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen. Now, keep in mind, when a pathogen attempts to invades a host, the host has numerous ways of preventing infection. Phagocytosis, for many pathogens, is the curtain call- where the phagosome combines with a lysosome and disintegrates the culprit into a mass of acid and bacterial bits. 

***Not for Coxiella burnetii***

No, not for this freak of evolution. *Coxiella burnetii* waits patiently to be joined with the lysosome and then REPRODUCES. That's right. The most prevalent method of termination is merely a bed room for these super saiyan-esque bacteria.

665,In regards to the evolution of humans - does our body discourage us from consuming fats?,"I realize fats offer much more energy per gram,  but if the benefits outweigh the risks , why have we developed a hormonal switch that tells us we're sated as soon as we begin to digest fats?  I do not claim expertise in endocrinology, but I think cholecystokinin is secreted from the small intestine fairly soon after fats reach it, in turn traveling to the brain, presumably the hypothalamus, where it signals an end to hunger - aka tells brain to STOP EATING.  Again, not a pro, but I'm not aware of an analogous response to proteins or carbohydrates.   Why would we develop such a response to fats and not proteins/carbs, if fats were not responsible for some type of reduction in darwinian fitness?

669,Blood suckers and evolution,"To preface.  It is intuitively plausible that, as humans, we have developed cravings (in the form of biological responses to lack of a component) to treat nutritional needs -  when we are running low of a vital nutritional component of our diet, we begin to crave foods/drinks/substances that will satisfy that requirement.   We also possess some biological responses to substances upon the arrival of said component which end the cravings.  I guess you could almost call it an inducible system.  

If that is the case,  then it is reasonable to presume that some animals have evolved a craving for certain types of nutritional needs.  Mosquitos, ticks, vampire bats, etc all maintain a diet heavily partitioned on blood.  Blood contains numerous things that are found no where else in the body, such as LDL and HDL. 

If this is the case with blood-suckers, do they have some type of biological need for LDL/etc that can only be fulfilled by consuming blood?    In other words,   do these blood suckers have the necessary endogenous equipment to manufacture their own LDL/HDL? If they don't, then it would be reasonable to assume that they crave blood to satisfy their need for LDL/HDL.

The ultracentrifuge broke my test tubes introducing a strong source of error for my experiment, but I wanted to ask you all if there were other potential sources of error (the cells were engorged with virus and had a high nucleus ratio to cytoplasm). Are there also other check points before the stimulation step to make sure everything worked right?

710,Help with MS or PhD programs for international student - how to get in a program in Europe or USA,"Hello friends, I was wondering if anyone could offer me a bit of advice about my future studies – a hard task as you may see.


I am a third year biology student, in 4-year (240 ESPB) bachelor program Molecular Biology. I come from European non-EU country in transition (or as they say  - developing country) with little or better to say almost no opportunities in science. 
I have decent grades, not sure how to turn them into GPA since we grade from 6-10, 6 being the passing grade and 10 having &gt;95% results. So for now my average grade is 9,16.  I also volunteered in various science community events and in lab for the summer.  I’ve done 1 research project/paper by myself and I’m currently trying to get into another project.  Here ,  most of the professors in my university won’t let people near lab if they don’t have masters degree ( our funding is bad and lab equipment limited, so most of them won’t take any interest in undergrads and even grads, even if that means free workforce).  Not saying that they are bad,most of them are pretty awesome and friendly, but they don’t have resources to waste. I am mentioning this in order to explain how scarce opportunities for research here are and why I want to do what I am planning.


**I wish to enroll in some Masters or PhD program outside of my country.**  My goal in life is to work in research as that’s my biggest passion. However, in my country, opportunities are scarce as I have mentioned.  
I’ve applied to many exchange programs available to people form my country, and was accepted in some where costs were covered by half but shamefully I couldn’t afford that. I’m also fluent in English and have a TOEFL certificate.

Ok here’s the kicker – I don’t have money. I live with my divorced mother and we barely make by, but we are happy – and I get sort of stipendy for my grades from my university so that helps.  What this means, I need to find some program that would cover my living costs (which will be as humble as can be since I am used to humble life and won’t be bothered by that).  I wouldn’t mind working at all if it wouldn’t interfere with my studies (i know some programs offer positions as assistants to professors etc).  Without modesty - I am a bright and cheerful person and hardworking, so I am sure I would fit anywhere if I got the chance. If my current results are good enough to even consider something like this…


So, any ideas what to do? I’ve checked websites of many universities but I didn’t find much of a clear information about financial support for international students. I think it might be better to find out something from personal experience of other people. So any advice where to start etc will help. I know at the end I will have to continue browsing on my own but I’d like to hear your opinions as well.

777,I have a hypothesis on the purpose of the yawn with some supporting evidence. Would you kind biologists mind telling me if I might be on to something or full of crap?,"Thanks in advance folks!

**Disclaimer:**

This idea arrived as a bathroom revelation and the more I think about it, the more it makes sense (at least to me).  I'm going to apologize in advance for using a more conversational language than scientific.  I'm just a laywoman who's pieced together an idea through repetitious experiences and a little research.


**Forward:**

I'm currently being treated with paroxetine (Paxil) for social anxiety disorder.  Though my personal involvement with the medication is unimportant, the side effects are relevant.  Bear with me through this part...


**The ""evidence"":**   *evidence gets quoties because I'm not a scientist.*


* The most common and noticeable side effect for someone starting to take paroxetine is referred to as ""the yawns"" -- it causes a person to yawn nearly incessantly until their bodies become accustomed to the medication regardless of any feelings of sleepiness or tiredness.


* The most common and annoying side effect a person experiences when they stop taking paroxetine is overwhelming tinnitus.  Every sound in the environment is painful.  They can also hear sounds that are usually muffled out by the ear's construction.  For example, they can hear their eyeballs moving when their gaze changes and they can hear the fluid sloshing around in their brains when they turn their heads.  It is painful and often referred to as a ""brain zap"".


Being one of the many freaks with some control over their [tensor tympani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle) muscle I did a little reading on it.  A diagram of the muscle's location in the ear can be found [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Gray907.png).  Now, if you check out that diagram it situates that muscle right above the auditory tube, or internal ear canal.  This is the muscle that is responsible for dulling out all the sounds that happen inside your head and allows you to only primarily hear sounds external to your own biology.


A failure in the function of this muscle would explain the unique type of tinnitus that is so common with the cessation of taking paroxetine.  What, then, could cause that failure?


I believe that the cessation side effect of tinnitus is directly linked to the beginning side effect of yawning.  If somehow scanned the tensor tympani muscles of someone experiencing paroxetine withdrawal should appear shriveled and atrophied.  Likewise, the tensor tympani muscles of someone beginning to take the medication should appear swollen and engorged until their body adjusts to the chemical change.  **It is this muscle which, I believe, causes us to yawn.**


It's been suggested that the yawn is a way of getting additional air to the brain.  However, our body already has a method of achieving this more efficiently with a gasp reflex -- when startled we gasp in order to quickly supply an additional shot of oxygen to our brains and react appropriately to a possibly dangerous situation.


It's also completely possible to exercise a mini-yawn without any oxygen intake via the mouth or nose.  This results in the ears stretching inside and a flow of air over their parts.  


When our bodies are stagnant for a while we often have to peel ourselves off the surface on which we are resting -- arms on a desk while surfing the computer, a hand from the chin while propping up our heads, our legs from a vinyl or leather car seat, or our whole bodies from the skin of a lover once rested for a while.  We often adjust once the relaxed weight of our bodies begins to pull on skin which is stuck to a surface.


When a person starts to get sleepy their muscles will relax where possible -- they'll slump to a more comfortable seated position, or their eyelids will drift to a more half-mast state.  They will also yawn more frequently.


Yawns are also notorious for appearing while listening to long stories, lectures, or any situation which involves a lack of speaking, chewing, head, or eye movement.


Yawns also relieve ear pressure from altitude changes (a car trip through the mountains, for example).


**The actual hypothesis:**

I firmly believe that a yawn is nothing more than a stretch or readjustment of our tensor tympani muscles.  The air flow through the sinuses allows it to unstick from the surfaces it's laying against in order to allow it to stretch properly, much like the example of peeling yourself from a vinyl car seat (mentioned earlier).  It is this unsticking that makes a slight pop noise in our ears when we yawn -- what we are hearing is a relaxed muscle lifting itself from an internal surface and laying itself down again in a more comfortable position.


Changing altitude causes an uncomfortable internal ear-sticking which is relieved by the yawn.

A tired person yawns because their tensor tympani muscle is relaxing with the rest of their muscles, and the yawn readjusts its position to relieve that ""pull"".

A person listening to a story or lecture might not be tired, but it's been a while since they've made movements which require the tensor tympani muscle to be active (head movements, chewing, etc.).  It relaxes from lack of use, which results in the need for a readjustment yawn.




This is also why you don't see people yawning while dancing in a club -- their tensor tympani muscles are in constant use and don't need to be stretched.

_______________________________________________

**Summary, Conclusion, TL;DR for the lazy**
The sinus cavity is connected -- nose, eyes, ears, mouth.  We use our noses and mouths to yawn (in addition to our ears) to increase the air flow inside our ears and relieve the pressure associated with a stuck and unstretched tensor tympani muscle.

_______________________________________________

I would love to get some feedback on this hypothesis.  Biology people, what do you think?  If this is a viable hypothesis what would be the next step towards verification?


Thank you so much!

I'm working with a program that brings biology graduate students into inner city classrooms to teach them about basic genetics in a fun and interactive way. The idea is to expose them to activities and information that they wouldn't otherwise have access to in their normal class. 

The program runs 3 days. The first day of the program has us bringing in drosophila and c.elegans to teach them about different phenotypes and genotypes. That's great. The third day has us teaching them about DNA and we do a simple cheek cell DNA extraction so the kids can see their own DNA and take it home with them in a colorful eppendorf tube. That's also fun. It's the 2nd day that's a problem. They're supposed to learn about chromosomes that day, but the less has been re-worked so many times that it hardly makes sense anymore. We have them look at printed out karyotypes to look for differences between male and female (boring, and they don't really seem to understand what they're looking at) and then we have them make these really sad models of DNA out of pipe cleaners and post-it notes. Both of these activities are things their own teachers are more than qualified to do with them on their own (and many of the schools actually make better DNA models out of cooler stuff like marshmallows). 

I want to totally re-write the 2nd lesson, but frankly I'm stumped for activity ideas. I'm looking for something that would be more interactive and unique. I'd either teach them more about chromosomes, or make an entirely new lesson, since chromosomes fit in pretty well with the day 3 lesson. My ideas are either teaching them about how DNA becomes a protein (and what is a protein) or teaching them about evolution (problem with that is that while I feel extremely comfortable talking about evolution and addressing criticism of it, not everyone does and I want to make this a lesson that future TAs can do easily). 

Does anyone have any ideas or experience? Know any fun classroom activities about chromosomes or central dogma that are appropriate for middle school students?

855,question about Bio and travel research.,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to ask a question that has been bugging me as of late. I have a love of travel and biology and would like to combine the two into something more than just daydreams. I was wondering if there was any type of job or volunteer work for people who don't mind getting dirty and have a love of science. 

This all stems from a conversation I had with a close friend whom I had not seen in awhile and became a microbiologist phd. Over a few drinks back int he home town, we got together and chatted about some of the work he's been up to. He was pleasantly surprised that I was able to keep up with a good deal of the technical aspects and asked I had finally gone back to school. So I told him that I had kept up my reading but sadly I had chosen another field (a personal regret) so it's become sort of a hobby for me, one in which I still had secret aspirations. Well soon the conversation came to what I would like to do in the field. The only thing I could come up with was that I wanted to be on the front line, not in a lab(nothing wrong with that but I can't sit still well) and not micro biology since our conversation earlier was about cholera and I was still freaked out lol. After this long conversation he suggested that I would make an excellent field biologist,marine biologist, or a zoologist. I guess his suggestion stemmed from growing up together and him already knowing my tendency for doing stupid and crazy things just to get a better look at some random animal that happened by. Example, I once dove out of a boat while fishing to grab a large snapping turtle that I saw in the water just so I could check it out.

The field Biologist intrigued me and I began to wonder how people get sent to remote locations to take samples, discover new animals, and generally work on location. So I guess I'm asking what sort of path leads to this type of work? I know many areas involve field research but I was hoping to have a higher amount of it. Also is there any thing I can do now without a bio degree but still having a bachelors in a different field?  Any thoughts from the experts?

I am assisting with research in Panama this summer for a month and was looking for some advice on the types of clothing I should bring.  

If you have any preferences for the gear you bring with you, I'd like to hear about that as well.  It won't be my first time in the tropics, but it will be my first time doing research there over an extended period.  I'd like to pack appropriately.

From what I've gathered, linen military shirts (like oxfords) offer protection from insects and the sun and they dry quickly.  Anybody have any other suggestions?

What kind of pants should I be looking for?  I imagine cargo pants that zip off at the knee would be ideal, but what material should I purchase?  Should I get something that dries quickly or something more waterproof.  Would it be wiser to simply get some breathable waterproof pants to go over shorts?  

Ponchos vs. waterproof windbreakers?  A baggy poncho may get in the way while bushwhacking but I'm concerned that a windbreaker may get too hot. 

Regarding footwear, there are several differing opinions on appropriate footwear.  At this point I'm leaning toward plain wellington rubber boots to keep my feet dry and protected from fer de lance bites.  I'm told locals wear either flip flops or these.  I won't be doing any intense hiking; perhaps only a few miles from the research station and I'll be moving at a snail's pace while sifting through the undergrowth, collecting data.    

Socks:  wool hiking socks with a thin liner is what I've always worn when hiking.

Unfortunately my grasp of metabolic pathways is weak at best, and I'm having trouble explaining why this occurs. My best guess thus far is that the lack of oxygen prevents the electron transport chain from replenishing enough NAD+ to sustain glycolysis, meaning eventually there's no pyruvate and fermentation is impossible even with abundant NADH - but I'm really not sure if this is even correct or not.

I am a molecular bio major currently and was hoping that I could have some insight shed on my next few semesters. First off I should say that I intend on taking the MCAT and applying to medical school, being that it is a bit of a long shot I am also looking at BME or Bioinformatics in grad school if Med school doesnt pan out. I also got some poor grades in some intro classes that will need to be retaken to improve my gpa (the school will drop the initial grade and replace it with the grade after I repeat it to remove the poor grade from GPA calculations). That being said I will be through organic chem 1 and 2 over the summer and my fall semester is as follows:

* Genetics + Lab
 
* Cell Biology
 
* Introduction to Evolutionary Biology

* Human Systems Physiology + lab 

This totals 14 semester hours so far. I still need to take Physics 1 and 2 with their respective labs. 
I am considering restructuring this schedule to better prepare me for the MCAT in spring or after spring semester so I was thinking something more like:

* Physics 1 + lab
* Genetics + lab
* Cell Biology
* Intro to Evolutionary Biology
* Chem 1

This totals 17 hours so far and then in the spring take:

* Physics 2 + Lab 
* Zoology + Lab
* Molecular Biology + Lab
* Chem 2

This would total 15 hours and I would either take the MCAT in the spring semester or right after at the start of summer. After these courses would be completed I would still have to take Human Systems Physiology, Microbiology and lab, immunology, biochemistry, virology, and senior internship as well as one more repeat for GPA purposes. These last few courses would be spread over summer and fall or fall and spring of the 14-15 school year. I would start getting denied from med schools (just a joke, hopefully ill get in) after the spring semester of my junior year and should have enough time to also look at some grad schools in the area as a back up. Does this sound feasible or is there a better way I should be going about this?

I have considered being a biologist, forensic scientist, veterinarian, optometrist, and psychologist. I'm hoping I can gain some insight about what is like to be a biologist to determine if I should continue looking into becoming a biologist. I plan to major in biology for either path I go.

Instead, our teacher is having us choose a topic to present to class and the topic can be anything we are interested in as long as it focuses on biology. It needs to be 5-10 minutes long, informative, and we need to engage the class somehow. Or basically we need to present it in a creative way (No power points!)

Of course I picked a topic I know nothing about. And that's why I am here asking for any help at all. I'm desperate and have no faith that this project is going to end well for me.

Anyways, I was going to focus on how exactly we have evolved and theories about how we'll evolve in the future (considering the impact of technology, eating habits, pollution, etc.)

Are there any good sites I should know about? Books I should read? Videos I should watch?

Got any cool ideas of creative ways to present this topic? The suggestions from our teacher were to sing a song, act out a play, do a dance, pretty much anything that will give a shy-antisocial-paranoid person like myself nightmares.

I started my graduate career as an MS student right after undergrad (had no lab experience, MS program seemed like a good idea to get some).  Rather than finishing the MS program (which I stumbled through for about 1.5 years), I decided to jump into the PhD program at the same institution, working in the same lab on the same project (thinking that maybe another year or so would give me an opportunity to expand on my project/turn things around/get a publication).

I'm not an expert chemist by any means. Can I calculate osmotic pressure for all of the dissociating chemicals and add it to the pressure that I (generally) can look up for certain molarities of the larger molecules? Is this not quite how osmotic partial pressures will work?

998,I am having a slight crisis. Any advice would be very welcome.,"This past (junior) semester, I was selected to take a trip to Japan with the biology department at my university, flight/accommodations paid for. Great, right? All I had to do was agree to take a high-level conservation genetics course.

I took the course, and I got a C+. At first, it didn't affect me, because as an A and B student, taking a hit like a C+ was well worth a life-changing, nearly free trip to East Asia. Also, one of the reasons I wasn't doing so hot in the genetics class was because I was devoting a lot of attention to a much harder course that semester (the electricity/magnetism version of Physics), of which I was content to leave with a B-.

Grad school applications are in my near future, so I talked with my advisor about how this C+ grade was going to affect my admission consideration. She said that because it is a class within the major, it could definitely hurt me in admissions.

This worries me, because: 1. It is not at all a field I am going into (I'm going into vertebrate anatomy/morphology), 2. I took it primarily for a trip to Japan, 3. I would have devoted more time to the Conservation Genetics class had I known that it would've helped my grad school admissions more.

I hope you can understand my frustration.

My advisor also told me that it is against school policy to remove a grade from my transcript, so I should just concentrate on future classes/grades/research.

r/biology, how much do you think this could hurt me? The reason for the long spiel was because I was considering including it in a cover letter for my application in hopes that admissions may not consider the grade as much.

I understand that there is more to grad school admissions than a grade. My GPA is now 3.28, 3.33 in the major, and I have had around three years of research experience. I have one paper almost ready to sent out for publish, the promise of two more to be sent to professional medical journals, and an honor's thesis for my senior year.

&gt; The TCR of classic adaptive CD8 T cells recognizes MHC I-associated peptides (MIPs). MHC I genes are polygenic, extremely polymorphic and represent the most conserved MHC genes. **In most modern human populations, the majority of MHC I alleles have been acquired by introgression from archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans)** ... Furthermore, evidence suggests that self MIPs excreted in body fluids act as chemosensory signals for neurons in the vomeronasal organs and may thereby influence mate selection and social behaviours in several vertebrates.

* ""Immune signalling in neural development, synaptic plasticity and disease"" (2004)

&gt; Research has long supported the view that the brain is immunologically privileged, in part because normal, uninfected neurons were not thought to express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Recently, however, it has been shown that **neurons normally express MHC class I molecules in vivo.** Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that neuronal MHC class I does not simply function in an immune capacity, but **is also crucial for normal brain development, neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity and even behaviour.** These findings point to new directions for research, and imply that immune proteins could be involved in the origin and expression of neurological disorders.

...

&gt; **over 60 studies to date have noted a genetic correlation between schizophrenia and MHC class I**, although these results remain controversial (REFS 73,74; reviewed in REF. 75). Environmental factors probably also have a crucial role, because identical twin concordance rates are only ~50% (REFS 76,77).

* ""Common polygenic variation contributes to risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder"" (Aug 2009)

&gt; Here we show, using two analytic approaches, the extent to which common genetic variation underlies the riskof schizophrenia. First,we implicate the major histocompatibility complex. Second, **we provide molecular genetic evidence for a substantial polygenic component to the risk of schizophrenia involving thousands of common alleles of very small effect. We show that this component also contributes to the risk of bipolar disorder, but not to several non-psychiatric diseases.**

* ""Evolutionary origin of bipolar disorder-revised: EOBD-R"" (Oct 2011)

&gt; Given evidence of Neandertal contributions to the human genome, **the hypothesis is extended (EOBD-R) to suggest Neandertal as the ancestral source for bipolar vulnerability genes** (susceptibility alleles). The EOBD-R hypothesis explains and integrates existing observations: bipolar disorder has the epidemiology of an adaptation; it is correlated with a cold-adapted build, and its moods vary according to light and season. Since the hypothesis was first published, data consistent with it have continued to appear.

* ""Maternally Acting Alleles in Autism and Other Neurodevelopmental Disorders: The Role of HLA-DR4 Within the Major Histocompatibility Complex"" (2010)

&gt; **Maternally acting alleles are novel contributors to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, and with time, more are being reported in this rapidly moving field.** As with autism, neurodevelopmental disorders are considered to be complex disorders in which multiple genes contribute to the clinical phenotype and in which gene effects are modified by environmental factors. Nearly all of the genes that have been reported as contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders act in the affected individual, i.e., the child or adult with the neurodevelopmental disorder. However, **some of the genes that are now being identified for these disorders are maternal genes that act in the mothers to contribute to the phenotype of their affected offspring.**

...

&gt; At present, at least 35 reports of these maternally acting gene alleles have been published (Table9.1). Nearly all of these reports of maternally acting alleles involve neurodevelopmental disorders. Their number has more than doubled since the topic was first reviewed in 2003 [1]. It is possible that maternally acting alleles are a characteristic and even defining feature of neurodevelopmental disorders, but more work is needed to clarify their impact.

* ""Risk Factors for Autism and Asperger Syndrome: Perinatal Factors and Migration"" (Oct 2010)

&gt; three parental characteristics and two obstetric conditions emerged as potential risk factors for autism; advanced paternal and maternal age, **maternal immigration**, growth restriction, and newborn hypoxia. One study found advanced maternal age to be specifically associated only with Asperger syndrome, but most studies did not report the risk factors for Asperger syndrome and autism separately. **Several investigators have reported an increased risk for autism in children whose mothers were born outside Europe or North America** . **Lauritsen et al. (2005) found an association between immigration from outside Europe when investigating the whole group of ASD, and in a recent Swedish study, Barnevik-Olssonet al. (2008) found a strong association between maternal immigration from Somalia and risk of autism or PDD-NOS.** Maternal immigration was not found to be a risk factor for autism in an American study, but maternal black ethnicity was.

&gt; ...

&gt; A strong positive association between autism and maternal birth outside Sweden was found; the magnitude of the association was similar across the time periods (p value for homogeneity = 0.44), and the association remained significant in the multivariate analysis. Quite contrary to this, a significant negative relationship between Asperger syndrome and maternal birth outside Sweden was detected (p value for homogeneity across timeperiods = 0.85).

From [a previous comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/lu2m1/til_after_65_million_years_of_separate_evolution/c2vmnhp):

Social species need to maintain stable internal variation (a diverse, stratifiable tribe is more adaptable than a homogeneous one).  Part of that diversity comes from variations in the copy number of certain modular genes (the copying happens more frequently in certain chromosomal regions).  Primates have an especially large portion of important genes clustered in copy-prone areas.

The phenotypic variation among humans is partly due to copy number.  Language allows a species to benefit from even greater internal cognitive diversity (different minds fitting into the same tribe = good for adaptation).  Stably integrating specific intervals of genetic variation probably became an evolutionary priority in our recent past.  We essentially added a bit of volume to our species' point in the space of all possible genomes.  The additional breathing room makes it easier to very rapidly accelerate or change direction (in the evolutionary sense) by duplicating and deleting stuff that's already there.  This type of genetic divergence won't show up under regular sequencing methods (it was 'junk DNA' until 2006).

1. Digested a plasmid (pGEX-2T) and did gel electrophoresis
2. Performed Southern Blot. We hybridized probe DNA labeled with DIG to the DNA on the membrane. We then added Alkaline phosphatase attached to an antibody that binds to DIG. A substrate was then added. 
3. When Alkaline Phosphatase reacts with the substrate, a color change occurs. This appears on the membrane, and we assume that this means the corresponding bands on the gel contained the DNA complementary to the probe. 

What's weird is that only a few bands appeared on my membrane. They want us to determine whether the probe we used is complementary to the plasmid insert, or the vector DNA itself. The bands that appeared on my membrane are not consistent with either of those possibilities. 

If the probe hybridized to the insert, then I don't see enough bands, and the bands that do appear on the membrane do not correspond to where the insert DNA would have transferred from the gel. 

If the probe hybridized to another part of the plasmid, then I also do not see enough bands, although I do see two bands that would be consistent with this. 

My thinking is that I should have seen bands in all the lanes since vector DNA and insert DNA are present in at least one band in all the lanes we ran. I only see bands in the first few lanes. I even see bands on the membrane where there were no bands on the gel. I'm really confused.

I'm really upset that science education in the USA is such a joke compared to the rest of the developed world and decided that I would try to improve the classes that I assist in teaching when I became a PhD student. What I've been consistently met with is condescension or outright dismissal when I point out areas that are lacking. 

For example, we have a great concept book as part of the curriculum, but almost never utilize it beyond the occasional discussion. The students don't have the opportunity to get credit for putting in the work when they were told from the beginning that it they would. They actually tell me they want to be assessed on it b/c they're putting in the work and they find it interesting! Isn't that amazing? It seems intuitive that intellectual interest ought to be stimulated and encouraged. Pulling a fast one on the students by getting them to read the book and not adapting your class to it is going to teach them to not waste their time doing extra work when they can get a good grade by spending more time on the regular busy work. When you're looking for a job as a nurse (most of my students are nursing majors), you're judged heavily on your grades, not whether you understood the unassessed higher-order thinking material even though it can be vital to your career and to your patients. 

We've also had problems where +90% of the students miss something on a quiz, when in past years there has been no problem. I'm really not inclined to think the students in 2011 are so significantly different than 2010, 2009, 2008, etc that it is their deficiency and not poor or ineffective coverage of that material in this run of the class. I've been told rather than they should have known it and that it can't be our fault. 

The general response has been ""I worked hard to make this class and I'm an expert so it can't be a problem on my end"" with customer service-style qualifiers like ""your opinions really matter to us.” I know that I can be an argumentative person and that at times I've continued to defend a point when we have other things to get done, but decisions get made then and there. They open the discussion to how we want to do something, say how they want to do it and then systematically reject changes and go with the original suggestion of the professor. The only ideas that are given some attention are ones that don't require the professors to do anything different.



Edit: I just got home after a meeting, the majority of which was to tell me for a good hour that I should shut up and ""remember what side of the table I'm on"" (that of the teachers, not the students), so I'm a little flustered and upset and haven't really read over this.

So I'm wondering what you fine people think of polio. From what little I've learned from TWiV and TWiP it sounds to me like working at other diseases such as malaria would be much better, and that eradication of Polio is more of a PR thing (humanity PR or something I guess, ""hey we eradicated polio"" sounds better to many than ""we've come close to eradicating polio and worldwide cases of malaria is down by X %!"").

I realize it would be very difficult to get rid of malaria as I'm pretty sure we have reservoir hosts in nature and the only way of getting rid of it is to get rid of swamps - which isn't really possible in areas such as Vietnam. But working on disease prevention (anti-mosquito stuff perhaps?) or [new medicines](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/11/111117135722.htm) could probably get us a long way.

115,An evolution debate with my brother,"My older brother is a creationist. He does not believe in a deity, per say, but he definitely believes that an intelligent force designed the universe and life on Earth. We had a debate about evolution, and it left me with a couple of questions that I was hoping to get answers to. More to the point, I'm just trying to get more information to reaffirm my position based on some of the arguments he made.

**This is going to get pretty wordy, but all of my specific questions are going to be bold'd for sake of convenience.**

One of the first things he argued was that evolution and natural selection are actually opposite processes, which seems absurd to me. His argument was that natural selection eliminates genetic diversity, while evolution is a process that encourages genetic diversity. As an example, he discussed how African Elephants are starting to lose their tusks because whatever gene sequence that encourages tusk growth is being eliminated from the gene pool due to poaching; hence, the genetic diversity of the species shrinks. I tried to counter by arguing that dogs and wolves were a great example of genetic diversity that we can witness today, but he said that wolves and dogs are canine subspecies and don't really count (**is this true?**)

**How do I demonstrate mechanically (and using examples if possible) how genetic mutations don't always involve in the weeding out of one species over another, thus allowing for genetic diversity? Or am I even asking the right question here?**

He does believe in micro-evolution (again, using the elephants as an example), just not macro-evolution. This led to a question neither of us had a position on: **at what point does one organism become genetically dissimilar enough to a parent species that it becomes its own species? How is that species differentiation determined?**

Finally, we talked a bit about scientific dating methods. He started with his (usual) argument that carbon dating is only effective up to a couple of hundred years (he said even the premier folks at Berkley admit this). **Is this true?** I understand that carbon dating is only good for a few tens of thousands of years, but my brother was arguing that it was only good for maybe 1500-2000 years.

He further attacked all dating methods in general (after I told him that carbon dating was not used to measure fossils more than a few thousand years old anyway). His argument was that the half-life of all isotopes used to date fossils and rocks are impacted by the environment of the Earth, so we can't really know how fast isotopes would have decayed more than a few thousand years ago. **Is that true? I thought some isotopes had a demonstrably more stable half-life than others.**

Obviously, I need to do some solid reading. I just picked up ""The Greatest Show On Earth"", and I figure ""The Selfish Gene"" would be an invaluable read as well. Other suggestions would be most welcome, though.

117,Can Reddit help with some speculative biology fact-checking for my science-fiction? Details and questions inside pertaining to human CELLS.,"So in my science fiction the paradigm shift from our world to the one of my story is because of gene therapy. There was research being done on DNA-hacking to which the public political world applied the misnomer 'vaccine'. This 'vaccine' was a means of strengthening cells to make them imperturbable and perfectly self-replicating so that things like AIDS, cancer etc become obsolete. 

This 'vaccine' gets stolen before being fully tested, by a political leader in Africa fishing for votes by showing himself capable of handling the AIDS crisis, and this ends up causing a highly contagious outbreak of disease which quickly builds to epidemic proportions. As a swift response, this same lab team works out the kinks in the 'vaccine' and manufactures as much as they can, as fast as they can.

The people who do receive this vaccine end up having their entire cellular structure revamped and strengthened to the point where their bodies have all this excess energy that would normally be devoted to cellular reproduction but instead is just sent to the brain by default as though to say: 'aw, screw it, the brain always needs energy, why don't we just send it there.'

This leads to the development of amplified cognitive skills such as telepathy, etc. and the story really begins there. 

Furthermore there are people with this full-blooded revamp such as those who took the 'vaccine' themselves or children of parents who both possess the revamped DNA, and there are half-and-half kids who do not have the full immunity. Someone with half regular DNA ends up being able to manufacture very strong cells with short lifespan so they have to spend a bit more energy recreating these otherwise perfect cells unlike the full-blooded people. They then become a gateway for the epidemic illness to mutate and this begins to happen, causing panic.

This Thanksgiving holiday, your long-lost uncle Leo is coming over for dinner.  Leo owns a store in New York City that sells lampshades and thinks that except for people studying to be doctors or lawyers, college is a waste of time.  Furthermore, he thinks that if you do decide to go to college you should take business classes.  You just know that at dinner, he’ll ask what you are studying in college and that when you tell him “Biology!” he’ll shake his head and declare that you are wasting your time while adding “What are you going to do when you graduate?  Open a “biology” store?”  

Be prepared to respond to your Uncle Leo’s challenge.  Using two different examples from vertebrate natural history demonstrate to your Uncle Leo the importance and relevance of studying biology in college.  Your response cannot use examples that are of biomedical relevance.

This one student (she's actually pre-vet, not pre-med)comes to ALL of my office hours and ALWAYS asks stupid questions (but she's been backing off a bit after FINALLY getting the hint when I have to keep telling her 'I can't tell you the answers'). Questions that have sometimes can be answered by simply reading the first pages of the lab experiment chapters in BOLD and ITALICIZED font. She is disrespecting my time by EXPECTING me to answer the questions for her and disrespecting the other students who can actually answer the questions without relying on me

She has also sent me emails expressing dissatisfaction over the fact that I don't answer her emails WITHIN 24 HOURS! I answer most emails I get from students (and I answered ALL of her emails in the past, before she started getting really annoying). I have not answered some other students' emails in the past, and they didn't make these stupid demands on me. I even agreed to meet with her outside of my office hours to provide extra help for her.

Finally, not only does she and her lab partner constantly TALK OUT LOUD during my lectures (I don't know if they're actually TRYING to whisper or not, but I can still clearly hear them), but she whines and complains like a total ***** over my grading and how she thinks she had no way of knowing she got the answers wrong (on the graded lab report sheet I hand back to each student, I list the things they needed to mention to receive full credit).

She also accused me (and may have also tried mocking my voice while doing so) of not adding the total score correctly on her recent lab report 'because the calculator says so' even though I was able to add the numbers in my head and prove her wrong.

To all the knowlege i have gained most scientists say that evolution is caused by minor mutations in species that is more favorable and promotes reproduction. Sexual reproduction became the most favorable among the most complex species because of being able to combine gene pools, however my question is how did asexual organisms evolve into extremely complex sexual organisms? I'm having trouble understanding how perfect sexual reproductive organisms evolved from asexual organisms through slight mutations over time. The way i see it is an organism would have to evolve in to two separate groups, male and female and then once fully evolved (which i would assume took a long time according to evolution) worked perfectly together and changed the species from asexual to sexual.

I wrote in the lab reports of the annoying students how they got some questions wrong because 'if you had listened, instead of been talking OUT LOUD (which is extremely rude), then you would've understood the lab and not gotten the question wrong"". That is because there were no more class lectures. If there was one more, I definitely would've stopped the lecture and thrown them out.

If they accuse me of wrongdoing, whats the worst that can happen to me? I'm likely to drop out of grad school at the end of this semester (for other personal reasons) but may apply to another program (ie, law school)

The thing is, I know the book is old, and I dont know how ""up to date"" are the ideas presented in that book, I know theres also The Human Zoo , The naked women/men by the same author.

So my question is, are these books up to dates with recent discoveries/investigation/theories? And if they are, which of them do you think would be a better present?

Surely I understand that we had to do the regular (non-bacterial) PCR on the sample tissue's extracted DNA in order to get the partial-cytb amplimer so we can ligate it into the vector. However, prior to running an EcoRI digest, we had to run a PCR reaction using live cultures, and I don't understand why.

They then need to explain the normal response, what’s wrong, and where in the pathway there is a problem to the rest of the class.

I am a 22 year old Freshman undergrad and I recently declared my major in Genetics and Biotech (Botany emphasis).  I am looking for advice for my current situation and also looking further down the road.

I am going to preempt this response, yes I have been talking to professors and advisers but I want more input.  Also, I just feel a need to vent because with finals week approaching I am just in pure agony over my Chem final.

So this is my situation.  I had far to many delays in getting started in college so I am a older Freshman and it has been years since I have done any academics so all of my high school preparation is lost (I wasn't an idiot just a minor slacker who got bitch slapped by life a few times).  My issue is with Chemistry.  God I hate this subject.  I avoided taking it in high school, big mistake on my part.  So here I am working on general chem and it is driving me crazy because every single day there is new material.  I have never done anything like this before in my life and I am only pulling a C.  This class is complicated and moves at a pace that I feel I cannot keep up with.

This scares me because I'll have to take more general chem, organic chem, biochem etc before I graduate.  Problem is I love Biology but Chemistry is critical to it and I just don't get it.  So basically what I am asking for this is has anyone else faced this issue before or are all Biology majors also Chemistry prodigies?  Any tips on working through this so I don't end up falling on my face?  Can you be a successful Biology major who is a C chemistry student?

Second question is regarding grad school.  For those of you who have been through this what would you say to a new undergraduate to best prepare him to get where you are?  What do you wish you knew just starting college?  Future job prospects?  Is grad school even worth it etc?  Anything is much appreciated.

The good news is that while I might not be able to get lab experience this year maybe next summer and next fall for sure I should be able to get started which means I should have three years of research and/or lab experience before I graduate, that makes me feel somewhat confident.

&gt; …aspects of human uniqueness arose because of a primate evolutionary trend towards increasing and irreversible dependence on learned behaviours and culture — perhaps relaxing allowable thresholds for large-scale genomic diversity.

* Human uniqueness: genome interactions with environment, behaviour and culture  (*Nature Reviews Genetics*, 2008)

&gt; Interestingly, some of the deviations seen in the Neanderthal are present also in the modern human, whereas others are not. The latter group of sequences may indicate **copy-number differences [CNVs]** that are unique to the **Neanderthal** relative to the modern human genome sequence.

* Analysis of one million base pairs of Neanderthal DNA (*Nature*, 2006)

&gt; Chromosomal regions that are hotspots for primate-specific segmental dups […] frequently coincide with the breakpoints of **CNVs** found in **autism and schizophrenia**

* A genomic point-of-view on environmental factors influencing the human brain methylome (*Epigenetics*, July 2011)

&gt; Introgression did take place between the ancestors of Europeans and the Neanderthals, and that introgression involved substantial parts of the Neanderthal genome that are scattered among modern humans. Will some of these Neanderthal fragments be found to be important in **cognition, language ability, and other higher brain functions**? To find out, it will be necessary to understand the human **epigenome** and transcriptome in detail.

* Genetic and Phenotypic Consequences of Introgression Between Humans and Neanderthals (*Advances in genetics*, Nov 2011)

&gt; In most modern human populations, the majority of **MHC I** alleles have been acquired by introgression from archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans)

* Origin and plasticity of MHC I-associated self-peptides (*Autoimmune Review*, Nov 2011)

&gt; ...accumulating evidence indicates that neuronal **MHC class I** does not simply function in an immune capacity, but is also crucial for normal **brain development, neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity and even behaviour**.”

* Immune signalling in neural development, synaptic plasticity and disease (*Nature Reviews Neuroscience*, 2004)

&gt; Eight autistic people have been associated with my group […] They are there because of their intellectual and personal qualities. I believe that they contribute to science because of their autism, not in spite of it.

&gt; The hallmark of an enlightened society is its inclusion of non-dominant behaviours and phenotypes, such as homosexuality, ethnic differences and disabilities. Governments have spent time and money to accommodate people with visual and hearing impairments, helping them to navigate public places and find employment, for instance — we should take the same steps for autistics.

I have an Immunology degree (B.Sc) and I'm currently studying for a Masters in Immunology of Infectious Diseases. 

I used to be sold on the idea of a life in academia and going down the whole PhD route. However, I'm really starting to feel like this isn't for me. Things like the amount of time that kind of position would take up and stupid things like what would I do if I needed to take time off to start a family. I wouldn't want to be stuck in a lab until 10pm when I had small kids at home, if you get me.

I'm very passionate about animals and careers such as Veterinary Pathologist or Immunologist seems like something I'd be really interested in. The only problem is, you need to be a vet for these careers, and I'm not.

Then, donors and patients search for projects they might be interested in.  If they see how a project might help a patient, they donate.  We send you a check, minus PayPal and checking fee.  You get 95% of the total donations when all said and done.  Even if your lab doesn't need the money, this will allow you to connect with the people you're helping.

It's completely **free for labs to join**.  Your only obligation is to send out periodic updates about your progress.  Again, you don't need to give out specifics.  For a patient, just seeing that they contributed to finding an answer, no matter how small, can be hugely uplifting.

574,Just started learning about Drosophila genetics but confused on how to do map an autosomal dominant mutation. Any fly geneticists in the house?,"Let's say you have a mutant fruit fly and you want to know on which of the fly's chromosome this mutation lies on. Initially, you screen for X-linked mutants; your mutagenized male flies are mated to attached-X female flies (this is to inhibit recombination between the female and male X-chromosomes so that you always know where your mutation should be).

You test for sex linkage by using the FM7a balancer flies; the FM7a balancer has a series of inversions in its X-chromosome to inhibit recombination. It also carries a dominant marker to allow you to know exactly if your fly has one FM7a X-chromosome, two FM7a X-chromosomes, or no FM7a X-chromosomes (its X-chromosomes come from the non-FM7a fly, the original mutant male). You mate your mutant male to this FM7a fly and get out each of the above types of flies, for males and females. Your results: all of the flies that come out of this cross are mutant, suggesting autosomal dominant.

Going off of this data, you want to map your mutation to an autosome. The fruit fly has three autosomes: chromsomes 2, 3, and 4. The 2nd and 3rd are quite large whereas the 4th is small. Typically, people just ignore the 4th unless data rules out chromosomes 2 and 3.

This is my understanding of how to map for an autosome, based on what little information I have been able to find on this subject (there's a surprising little amount of how-to-do stuff on basic fly genetics it seems and what exists is not detailed): One takes a fly which carries a balancer for the 2nd and 3rd chromosomes, SM6b and TM6b (which carries a dominant mutation, respectively, for curly wings and tubby bodies) and mates this female to your mutant male. In the F1 generation, you get SM6b/+; TM6b/+ flies; this fly should act mutant. I am then told that you should take this SM6b/+; TM6b/+ fly and mate it to a wild-type fly to get out +/+; +/+ (this fly should again still act mutant). After this, I am completely lost as how one gets to being able to map your mutation to an actual chromosome.

Ideally, one would like to have a fly which carries three balancers, either one balancer for the 2nd and two balancers for the 3rd or two balancers for the 2nd and one balancer for the 3rd and you try to get out flies which are balancer/+; balancer/balancer and test this fly to see if it is acting mutant or not or test balancer/balancer; balancer/+ and test to see if this fly is acting mutant or not. If the former one is acting mutant, then the mutation is probably on the 2nd chromsome. If the latter one is acting mutant, then the mutation is probably on the 3rd chromsome. However, having more than two balancer chromosomes tends to really mess up the viability of the fly and you just don't get many (if any at all) flies.

So my question is: If you have what you think is an autosomal dominant mutation in Drosophila melanogaster, how do you map it to an autosome? If anyone can please help me, it would be greatly appreciated as I've already searched through the standard go-to books of [Fly Pushing](http://www.amazon.com/Fly-Pushing-Practice-Drosophila-Genetics/dp/0879694920) and [Drosophila: A Laboratory Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/Drosophila-Laboratory-Handbook-Michael/dp/0879697067). Both do not provide many clues/ideas. I understand how to do the part that comes afterwards, the recombination mapping, however.

593,"Dec 2011: ""We found that the Xavánte experienced a remarkable pace of evolution: the rate of morphological change is far greater than expected for its time of split from their sister group, the Kayapó, which occurred around 1,500 y ago.""","**[Cultural diversification promotes rapid phenotypic evolution in Xavánte Indians](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/12/13/1118967109)** (Dec 19, 2011)

&gt; Shifts in social structure and cultural practices can potentially promote unusual combinations of allele frequencies that drive the evolution of genetic and phenotypic novelties during human evolution. These cultural practices act in combination with geographical and linguistic barriers and can promote faster evolutionary changes shaped by gene–culture interactions. However, specific cases indicative of this interaction are scarce. Here we show that quantitative genetic parameters obtained from cephalometric data taken on 1,203 individuals analyzed in combination with genetic, climatic, social, and life-history data belonging to six South Amerindian populations **are compatible with a scenario of rapid genetic and phenotypic evolution, probably mediated by cultural shifts**. We found that the Xavánte experienced a remarkable pace of evolution: **the rate of morphological change is far greater than expected for its time of split from their sister group, the Kayapó, which occurred around 1,500 y ago**. We also suggest that this rapid differentiation was possible because of strong social-organization differences. Our results demonstrate how human groups deriving from a recent common ancestor can experience variable paces of phenotypic divergence, probably as a response to different cultural or social determinants. We suggest that assembling composite databases involving cultural and biological data will be of key importance to unravel cases of evolution modulated by the cultural environment.

How frequently do you do animal-based research in labs and/or undergraduate research? And what types of animals and procedures are common?

653,Sifting through the Nonsense.,"So I was listening to a rather interesting infomercial on a medical radio station about the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids such as krill and fish oils in a product similar to [this](http://www.purityproducts.com/purityEcommerce/control/productDetail;jsessionid=121D3F7E80D21B37F1BF72D159C7B331.jvm1?productId=krill-omega-3-super-formula&amp;productCategoryId=&amp;viewSize=5&amp;viewIndex=2&amp;sortReviewBy=-productRating#rating) one.  The promised benefits are of course enticing, but I'm far too much of a skeptic to be reeled in by an infomercial made by the producers of a product.  That being said however, I don't believe it is healthy to disregard what could be true simply because someone is advertising their product with it.  

So here's my question:  Does anyone know of a biologically rigorous, easy to access and use website or journal that does/compiles trustable research on nutrition products, or even products in general?  

Furthermore, does anyone know of a website/journal/magazine etc.  that explains biological bases and implications of nutrition as well as offer ways to legitimately deal with the implications in your life?  I feel like there is so much homeopathy nonsense / pharmaceutical advertising and lobbying that it's hard to find your way.

On a related note, I was recommended by a family member a homeopathic ""natural"" cure for a very bad case of recurring dry skin I've had for most of my life.  I'm VERY skeptical of homeopathic stuff, but my family member was persistent, so I decided to humor them.  It worked like nothing I've ever had in the past, including prescriptions I've received from doctors.  I don't think there's anything more than chance involved in the fact that I found a working treatment for my condition that just so happens to be homeopathic, but I also cannot find anything **but** homeopathic resources (websites, etc) on the active ingredients, so I'm unable to sate my scientific curiosity as to why the active ingredients are working for me without setting up a lab of my own (which is obviously unrealistic given my financial situation).

TL;DR  Looking for website/other publication that scientifically analyzes homeopathic / nutritional products in a way similar to skeptoid and other easy-to-read, but thorough publications.

659,"A small question of ethics for you all, I don't assume that we'll get it right but we can try: Raising an ant farm to provide energy to the grid","So, like the title implies I was wondering not if it would be economically viable to raise ants merely to slaughter them wholesale to burn for power, I was wondering about the ethics behind it.

Since I do need some expert guidance on approaching this delicately without it turning into a flamewar, I rely on you to tell me I'm wrong because I raised the subject matter and I should be the one who is prepared to argue the bad side.

So, obviously while we can see humanity has a large need for energy, increasing by day and year, we can only rely on the huge amount of start-up capital that large corporations can use to get loans from banks to start up energy production to serve enough people cheaply enough that they don't really have a say in the matter; it's because that the side-effects of pollution are swept under the rug when these financial decisions are made, the people who will get hurt because we rely on cheap energy aren't going to go away and we can't just act like they're not there. 

I can't play pin the blame on the corporation right now, I have smaller bugs to fry. 

If by raising an ant farm I can get enough ants to make it viable to kill them for money, and I use this money to set up non-polluting sources of energy that can slowly make the polluting parts of energy production less attractive to the public so that eventually they get shut down, I will be able to shut down the ant farm once it's the last non-ethical manner of producing energy.

I kill ants to save my friends from what I feel are side-effects to the rampant capitalism, the politics we could discuss aside for now, would it be ethical to raise the ant farm, to use unwitting workers, only to kill it when I've no longer got a use for it?

Birds- length, wingspan, beat frequency, weight, etc.

738,"Does anyone use a cell-cell adhesion assay? Help me troubleshoot mine, please.","I have for several months been trying to develop an assay to measure adhesion between two populations of cells expressing either a ligand or its receptor at the cell surface. The ligand is HIV Env and the receptor is CD4. The setup is something like this:

I seed HeLa cells in a 96-well plate (10^4 cells per well) and transfect them with HIV provirus to get Env expression. After allowing for 24-36h expression, I add Calcein-AM-labeled Jurkat cells (which natively express CD4). I co-culture the cells for 3 hours at 4ºC (Env is fusogenic so I need low temperature to prevent cell fusion and only measure adhesion). I then gently wash the wells twice, fix, and read Calcein-AM fluorescence on a plate reader. I also simultaneously have wells of the transfected cells alone (I don't add Jurkat cells) which I DAPI-stain and read to normalize for cell survival differences due to different transfections.

This sounds like it should work, right? The more Calcein-AM fluorescence I read out of a well, the more cells adhered. I measure background cell-cell adhesion by having a mock condition (transfected with Env-deficient HIV provirus), so any additional fluorescence above that level should be specific Env/CD4-dependent adhesion.

Well, it turns out I just don't see any appreciable specific adhesion. There is really no difference in the number of cells adhering whether Env is being expressed or not. Here are some things I've tried:

- I have tried different extents of washing (0-4 washes), although the overall number of labeled cells is noticeably decreased with more washing, I still see no specific adhesion.
- I have tried using anti-CD4 antibodies shown to block the Env-CD4 interaction and, although I see a slight decrease in adhesion, this happens whether Env is being expressed or not!
- I have tried adding different numbers of Jurkat cells, ranging from 0.5-2 x 10^5 per well, still no specificity.
- I co-transfected a small amount of fluorescent protein (DsRed) and verified that my transfections are working with decent efficiency (~60-70%).
- Survival (based on DAPI readings) is very similar between Env-expressing and mock conditions.
- I have tried to visually assess adhesion instead of relying on the plate reader, and my visual estimates generally agree with the plate reader. I can also clearly see the difference between wells that have been washed twice and wells that have been washed 4 times.

I can easily fuse these same cells using the same transfection, that assay just runs at 37ºC (which permits fusion), so I know that the Env-CD4 interaction can take place between these cells. It is also published that Env-CD4-dependent adhesion is observed at 4ºC within 3 hours, but those papers are older and do not give enough detail on how they perform their cell adhesion assay for me to replicate, in principle however I am doing everything they were doing.

It seems to me that this assay should work, but I just can't figure out why I can't see any specific adhesion. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.",biology,1325530195,nastyasty,11,2,True,2012-01-02

886,Crayfish experiment; need help on design for an experiment.,"So I'm performing a crayfish experiment and I've decided to tell people about it because as far as I know of, nobody else is doing what I'm doing to these awesome critters.

Essentially, what I'm doing is testing their ability to scale surfaces.  I'm researching burrowing potentials for terrestrial crayfishes.  We have noticed a segregation of juveniles and adults based on what appears to be substrate preferences for burrowing.  But before we go jumping into substrate stuff (which is actually the target of another experiment I'm collaborating on), I'm testing their ability to climb a ramp at two angles: 45 degrees and 80 degrees, with ramps lined with mesh or sponge and seeing which material (ramp or sponge) along with the angle best allows them to scale.  I'll then be using the angle and material with the best results to test which factors influences the time it takes for them to leave the water and climb the ramp (testing water temps, photoperiod, predator/conspecific cues, etc). 

So far, the pioneering question, whether they'll actually can climb the ramp, has been answered with 9 results (out of twenty replications).  Of those results, we got 3 that climbed 45 degree mesh ramps, 3 that climbed 80 degree mesh ramps, and (frustratingly) 3 that climbed the 45-degree sponge ramps.  

My question, as a budding scientist, to you others who are more experienced is this: how can I interpret what I got in order to make a decision as to which material I should use?  I so far decided that 45 degree ramps should be used for my future replications.

&gt; Complex worker caste systems have contributed to the evolutionary success of advanced ant societies; however, little is known about the developmental processes underlying their origin and evolution. We combined hormonal manipulation, gene expression, and phylogenetic analyses with field observations to understand how novel worker subcastes evolve. **We uncovered an ancestral developmental potential to produce a “supersoldier” subcaste that has been actualized at least two times independently in the hyperdiverse ant genus Pheidole. This potential has been retained and can be environmentally induced throughout the genus. Therefore, the retention and induction of this potential have facilitated the parallel evolution of supersoldiers through a process known as genetic accommodation. The recurrent induction of ancestral developmental potential may facilitate the adaptive and parallel evolution of phenotypes.**

My question is where does that energy come from.  I know that these things are fast so can it really be brownian motion?

I dabble quite a bit in beer brewing, and I'm curious whether or not one would be able to identify yeast mutations using a gel electrophoresis. My theory was that it may be possible to create a reference map once you receive your initial yeast specimen, then every other generation or so, remap it using the gel and compare to the original.

The only issue I could see with this is just how much would the genetic makeup change? Would it be visible? Even if it does change, how would one go about identifying the mutation and ensuring it's not a negative one?

355,"r/Biology, Can you help me improve mouse colony management? Please?","So I have been recently tasked with managing my lab's mouse colony.  I have also been given the optional quest (+5 points toward completion of the promotion quest, which gives +5,000 salary and +3 benefits) of improving the databasing of the colony. 

Currently, Data is taken down in a binder, changes in which are then transcribed into a very large excel file, which is in turn printed in updated form and used to populate the binder.  This process is inefficient, makes sorting data a hassle at best, and is not particularly amenable to alerts for actions that need to be performed.

My PI suggested getting and using an iPad to edit the excel file data while in the colony rooms, but, as much as I would like an iPad, I don't think this is the solution.  I suggested in turn, a ruggedized tablet with an included barcode scanner such as is used in hospitals and similar settings.  As of yet, however, pricing has not been determined, and could prove to be prohibitive of this new method of data entry.

Regardless of the physical method of data entry used, I would also like to improve data storage.  In the past, I worked for the Peabody museum, and used software called eMu (electronic museum).  This software is both profoundly overpowered for this application, and somewhat over my head with regard to setup.  Instead, I've been using access, which should work well, once I learn how to properly design databases.

I was wondering if anyone could give me advice, words of wisdom, cautionary tales, etc. about the management of their animal colonies, as well as the software and hardware they use.

tl;dr
if you manage an animal colony using something more efficient than inscribed stone tablets, please advise.

EDIT: So i'm less worried about the hardware I will be using, and I want to focus on the database software.  As several people mentioned, there are lots of relational database programs either generic (like FM pro, access, bento, etc) as well as programs designed for colony management specifically.  As there are a dozen or so out there designed specifically for management, and as I don't want to install 10 free trials and spend 10 hours working with each program, can anyone comment on what DATABASE software they use, and its pros/cons?

I'm finding conflicting information on the whale pelvis' present role in reproduction. Assuming the primary original function of the pelvis was in locomotion and assuming it is currently non-essential for vivipary, then today it would be considered vestigial, right? However, if it has indeed become an essential part of the whale's reproductive physiology and it wasn't before, then this would be an exaptation. I think to get a handle on this the role of the pelvis in both present and past physiology would need to be characterized first and that's where I'm finding inconsistencies. Dang interwebz.

437,Population inbreeding. Somebody help me with this!,"I'm pretty well versed in evolution. I try to learn everything I can about it, mostly to combat the doubt of theists and be able to explain myself more eloquently, but I digress.

Something I frequently fall on in my line of thinking is the topic of inbreeding. How does inbreeding work in regard to geographically separated populations that are later found to thrive?

For example: Pregnant female iguana falls into the ocean and drifts onto a remote island (i'm stealing a lot of this from Darwin) and has her babies. Later, we observe that the island is thriving with these iguanas even though they have inbred.

I know i'm missing something simple, as I know we have a lot of genetic variation in our genomes, but I just can't figure this out on my own. I grew up with the understanding that if you inbreed, your children end up retarded or handicapped.

So is that what happens with most animal populations, too? But natural selection kicks in and most of the handicapped individuals die off, leaving the genetically superior ones to thrive and further inbreed?

I'm sorry if I sound naive, but it's hard to find information on all this. Thanks a lot!

**EDIT:** ""Natural selection works to remove individuals who acquire the above types of traits from the gene pool. Therefore, many more individuals in the first generation of inbreeding will never live to reproduce. Over time, with isolation such as a population bottleneck caused by purposeful (assortative) breeding or natural environmental stresses, the deleterious inherited traits are culled."" - Wikipedia.

530,The problem with double blind studies.,"Double-blind studies are treated as the gold standard of research as they are thought to ensure that the various human subconscious (and conscious) foibles do not interfere with the hard data.
Thinking about my own experiments, I've come across a serious limitation of double-blind studies (DBS from now). I'm curious if anybody can link to articles dealing with this or at least point out the flaw in my reasoning.

In short, DBS ensure that a significant result is valid. As the scorer has no idea if they are scoring the experimental or control group, they cannot erroneously (given a large enough sample size) misattribute a significant difference between control and experimental group.
However, this does not ensure that DBS ensure that the quantitative difference between control and experimental groups is valid. For example, let us assume a drug restores 50% of hair follicles in the sculpt. The effect is patently obvious, so the scorer can tell right away if they are scoring control or experiment (therefore, results are significant). However, now that the scorer knows which data is control and which is experimental, all the foibles kick in and he can skew the data even further (negating the point of the double-blind setup). The scorer, being payed by the drug company, can easily inflate the difference between control and experimental, resulting in the drug actually restoring 60%, rather than 50%, of hair follicles.

Where does that leave double-blind studies. If I'm correct in my reasoning, double-blind studies are only gold standards for comparing significant difference between groups, not ascertaining the quantitative difference between groups. In the case of our hair-follicle drug, the only way to get at its quantitative efficiency would be to compare it to other drugs on the market. This would result in data like this: Our drug is significantly better than control, significantly better than drug A, but not significantly better than drug B.",biology,1287069003,rolandde,20,3,True,2010-10-14

Obviously, I am not a PhD student and I recognize that I don't know that much about biology yet and doing grunt work is sort of my job at this point, but I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for summer programs (or grants, etc.) that would allow me to work more independently with the goal of publishing as a co-author.

630,Looking for information on eugenics/genetic engineering.,"Hey everyone,

I've asked this question in another subreddit, but I'm thinking that perhaps someone here might be able to help me out? Basically, this is what's goin' on:

I'm looking to write an essay about how depictions of the future in science fiction are actually social commentaries on the present. I'm looking forward to this immensely, but I know it would be beneficial to find some extra information about topics that are reoccurring in the works I've chosen. I would like to focus on eugenics/genetic engineering, but I'm sort of in a rut about good books to purchase. I'm looking for any advice as to books (or great articles, documentaries, or really anything else) that I could choose that would increase my understanding of them and their effect on the world population. 

Essentially, the books/movies I've chosen deal with a fictional scenario in which genetic engineering/eugenics is prominent and discuss how the population deals with this. The books themselves are easy reads, so I'm hoping to add some depth through looking into eugenics/genetic engineering a bit more. I'm loving the idea of getting a bit of science into my English work, but, at the same time, I do have to focus on how said topics affect humanity. I have tried to look for a few books about these topics, but any advice would be appreciated if there's someone out there who has read/heard/seen a great resource for information.

I had no idea whales came from a land based ancestor.
I understand natural selection, but it doesn't completely explain how a land based animal would somehow adapt to living in the water. It seems like too huge a change in environments to be correct. I mean if something gives an organism an advantage it will eventually (over millions of years) become prominent in the population. But how do whale ancestors decide to live in water? How do legs morph into fins? How do organs change form and blowholes appear and how does it gain ability to live in a saline environment?
I understand that this took place over millions of years. But if something is going to adapt to a new environment, wouldn't it have to survive in that environment first? It's not like a four legged ancestor could live in water for a couple hundred generations for it to start adapting to the water.
Is there some part of the picture I don't understand/possibly haven't been taught yet that would allow this to happen? Am I just over thinking this? No one has given me a straight answer yet, can someone explain this?

Imagine yourself living in a time and space when and where you and your race/species has fully understood how everything absolutely works. You have the capability to travel to the ends of the universe, to live eternally in good health, and get this, to create life de novo. Now this creating life business isn't as easy as a snap of a finger, unlike cooking dinner in this distant future. In fact, this vivogenesis requires building the most elaborate Machine ever conceived.

So you as project leader and a team of engineers set out to construct this Machine. You place into this Machine-system 200 elemental raw building blocks. You write a programming language of sorts to govern this system, and also electro-chemical-physical laws to define how these elemental blocks can interact with each other. Needless to say, this machine is a bit more complex than your run-of-the-mill automated Higgs-boson synthesis machine. This machine and its products intimately interact, and do not exist as separate entities.

You've constructed your Machine, what now? The team wrote a program for generating this very specific life form, designated as project title namuH. You load the program into the Machine-system and let it run. Because you're basically immaculate at this point in your time and space since you're so advanced, you're absolutely confident your program is flawless and will create a perfect namuH, and it does. The program specifies that to generate the namuH, several byproducts must be formed. The initial phase of the synthesis process yields an intermediate that looks nothing like the namuH, in fact it's tiny, nanoscopically tiny. This tiny intermediate is further processed and developed into a multi-body life form, but it's still very far away from the namuH. A few life forms existing as functional ""organisms"" are developed, and exit the developmental pathway as quasi-stable byproducts. These byproducts, you've designed, will actually serve to sustain the namuH once it's formed. Finally after a month or two of running the program with many byproduct organisms accumulated, the first namuH becomes operational.

You and your development team are stoked. During the 2 months of namuH-genesis, your team wrote up a patch to address the exceedingly long production/manufacturing process--because eventually you'd like to mass produce the namuH. This patch basically enables a copy, merge, randomize, paste function to occur between two interacting flavors of namuHs or any byproduct organisms to procreate new, unique life forms, thus bypassing running the original program from line 1 every time you wanted to produce a replacement life form. This update patch was not retro-compatible to certain byproducts, so they still function on the auto-regeneration program. One downside to this patch is that aberrations arise every time a life form is procreated on account of the randomization function; each individual is no longer perfect/free of mutation. However, your boss is still ecstatic you cut production time and manufacturing materials by several magnitudes of power.

Project namuH was special, because the intention was to create a life form that is self-aware, capable of self-regeneration, and possesses the ability to learn, rationalize, love, create ideas, and express intelligence--features that none of the byproduct life forms possessed in whole. Years down the line, Project namuH and its Machine-system reached operational self-sustaining sufficiency. Indeed the intelligent namuHs learned to appreciate themselves, each other, and the Machine-system that so elegantly sustained them and produced them. Because you and your team developed an entirely different set of physical laws from your own to govern namuHs, you have a hard time communicating to these intelligent creatures. Yet, you've grown very fond of them and you love them nonetheless.

Later on, your employer has decided to discontinue the project's funds. But since the system has become self-sufficient because of an excellent closed-system conservation of mass and energy, you and your team leave it running at no cost.

I'm working on a class project for school on technology and would love to get some input from you guys.

Would anyone be interest in a 'personal' [liquid handling robot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_handling_robot)?  Conventional liquid handlers are pretty expensive (~50k-100k) and are also pretty big.  Do you think there exists a market for a much smaller one designed to automate simple everyday tasks that is both cheaper and easier to use?  I guess I'm imagining a simple robot that can address and pipette between a set of 6/24/48/96/384 sized plates, 1.6/2.0mL standard eppendorf tubes or 0.2/0.6mL PCR tubes. 

Would anybody be interested in such a thing?  And if so,

* Would you buy it / get your lab to buy it for you if it were under $1000?  Under $500?
* At what price would you consider it more a 'personal' device like a set of pipettes or a computer, rather than a shared 'group' device.
* What would you use it for?  Sequencing reaction setups? PCR?
* Any other requirements that such a device would need before you would even consider it?

I think personal automation and robotics is a pretty fascinating topic.  The current wave of what the biotech industry considers ""personal automation"" is hardly personal, as devices like the Qiacube still cost a small fortune and are rarely used by only a single person.

789,[AskBiology] - What does it take to be a professor?,"I am an undergrad at a public university in America and up until recently I was on track to get a chemistry degree and later become a pharmacist. My heart was never really into it and recently I had a bit of a revelation and I realized that what I'd want to do more than anything is teach general biology at the university level as a professor. 

I've got no problem with public speaking and I'd like to teach to college-age students (and I wouldn't like to teach Middle or High School at all). I'm also interested in Biology but my current major is Chemistry and so I've only taken basic bio classes. While I believe I have the capacity to go the distance if I work hard my current GPA is subpar because I wasn't thrilled with my career choice and I haven’t been putting in my full effort. I've got a renewed sense of enthusiasm with the prospect of becoming a professor, even if it is a long, long way off.

Since my advisor doesn't know anything about being a professor and I'm not currently enrolled in a biology course to ask my professor I was hoping r/biology could help me out.

897,"Hi, I'm new here and have a few questions for you.","**Some background (I'll try to keep it short, but if you don't care please consider my questions below!)**

OK so I just declared biology as my major and want to know some things. First off, I had very little schooling growing up when it came to science (I went to small private Christian schools :o). Then, this semester I took an anthropology course and fell in love with it. With some research I decided to give Biology a try; as this new aspect of science that I have been sheltered from my entire life enthralled me. I chose Biology because I have recently become very interested in living organisms and how life in general works. I know that there are soon going to be advances in technology and understanding that will change the world (or mine at least). So that's pretty much where I am now, next semester I begin to take my core chemistry, trigonometry, and biology classes and hopefully begin to figure out specifically what I want to do.

 **Here are some questions I have right now:**

* The first thing I did after choosing biology was to subscribe to /r/biology, /r/chemestry, and a few other new subreddits that I have been scouring over astounding new information, where else should I go to learn more? Or where can I go to engage myself in the community of scientists/biologists?

* What should I do with a Biology major? I was thinking something along the lines of molecular biology and/or genetics, but I don’t necessarily know what each entitle. Where can I find more information on the different fields and pathways that I can take; either masters programs or job opportunities? 

* What books, journals, periodicals, magazines, and the like should I look into to read and learn from?

* I think I want to purchase a good microscope for cheap because I didn’t get one when I was a kid like you did, what is out there in the market and how much do I have to come up with to afford a decent one?

* And finally, what advice would you give yourself when you started to take school seriously?

I will probably add more questions in the comments as they come to me.

Now I’m here, and not so sure anymore. I still don’t have a clear end career goal in mind, but I know I don’t want to go into academia as a professor. I’m thinking something in government or industry, but I’m not so sure anymore.

I'm having trouble deciding if it's worth it and if there are better things for me to be doing with my time.

I have skills and qualities that should be utilized, but I don’t know where would be best to apply them. I am intelligent, have solid critical thinking skills, and good attention to detail. I’m reliable, easy to train, and acquire new skills quickly. I’m good at problem solving and putting out fires when organizing events. I’m patient, laid back, and deal well enough in customer service. I love to travel and handle foreign situations well.

I guess I was just a little disappointed when I found out that it was still a Carbon-based life form, it just uses Arsenic instead of Phosphorus.


I'm not all that surprised that a simple bacterium evolved the ability to utilize Arsenic as well as Phosphorus in an Arsenic-rich environment.  It parallels the discovery of anaerobic bacteria.


tl;dr: It seems much more plausible that this bacterium started out utilizing a Phosphorus backbone, then evolved the ability to use Arsenic as well (since it was found in an Arsenic-rich environment)  instead of the whole ""second genesis"" hypothesis.

Another three hours of drunken scientific discussion ensued. At the end, one of the post-docs made the comment ""Imagine how many other places in the United States this is happening right now. If you had a map and put a light at every place where people were, like us, excitedly discussing this paper (for better or worse), the entire US would light up.""

I've measured the minimum hearing threshold of the mice, and while the wild types and homozygous mutants are (mostly) normal, the distribution for the hets is very non-normal, and in fact looks bimodial.  To me this seems to indicate that it's a case of incomplete penetrance.

Does anyone have any idea of how I could ""prove"" that this is the case?  Any papers that could be suggested?

Thanks

EDIT - More details

1) We know the gene, and there are cases of people with mutations in the same gene.  All the humans have the primary phenotype, and some of the patients also have deafness (in some cases with incomplete penetrance), depending on the location of their mutation.

2) We are on effectively a pure B6 strain at this point (10+ generation back cross)

3) We are observing some hearing loss from young to medium to old in the WTs. (average 49, 66, 71 dB; 3%, 27% and 16% deaf)

4) Using a histogram (binned in 10dB ranges, middle aged mice), the WT have most of the readings in the 60-70dB range, the Hets have about equally split between 50-60 and 80+, and the homs are mostly in the 50-60 range.

-----------------------------------------

* While historians have proven adept at understanding the interplay between culture and epidemiology, science has been largely unable  to utilize evolutionary theory to inform epidemiology of the impacts of cultural evolution.  The modern synthesis of Darwinian evolution can be understood as an algorithmic process which leads to change over time, if and only if, the basic components of (1) imperfect self-replication and (2) subsequent differential survival are present.  Approaching epidemiology from this paradigm allows evolutionary theorists to utilize the vast social networks of the internet as an easily monitored and controlled  model system.  Such a model system has the potential to elucidate the integral ties between the infectious spread of units of culture, or memes, and pathogens. Careful, quantitative analysis of easily  mined data will prove to be a valuable tool in understanding public health concerns ranging from vaccination fear to the seasonal and pandemic flu in all corners of the globe.  The key to unlocking such a tool is approaching relevant cultural ideas from a perspective steeped in evolutionary theory, aided by an interdisciplinary approach which highlights the valuable untapped social networks and the web at large.  I am uniquely qualified to work within such a paradigm because my personal hobbies, private intellectual pursuits, and academic goals lie at the confluence of this novel approach.  


* At an early age, I found that I had a natural attraction and talent with computers which has developed into one of my strongest assets.  As is the case with most of my peers, much of my academic work and interpersonal communication have occurred via a wide array of technological mediums.  Upon beginning my undergraduate career in biology, I found that the amount of time which I could dedicate to my hobby was exceedingly small.  In order to maintain my hobby, I began working at the computer repair facility on campus and soon stumbled upon the biological systems surrogate of computer viruses.  Over the last five years, I have spent a significant amount of time observing the epidemic nature of these pseudo-pathogens and have worked closely with network security in developing quarantine and triage strategies.  While there are few other biological analogies, the speed at which computer viruses spread across a campus is nearly indistinguishable from the seasonal cold.  Therefore much of my non-academic college career has been spent working within the framework of epidemiology and technology.


* During my first quarter as a TA for an advanced course on evolution, I was searching for an unorthodox way in which to teach the most basic precepts of natural selection when I stumbled upon a lecture by the philosopher Daniel Dennett.  The purpose of the lecture was to discuss the pathogenic nature of ideas and their very real effects on individual and societal health.  Such a portrayal struck a nerve, due to my interest in pathogen-host coevolution, thereby launching me into a whirlwind of lectures, books, and eventually academic publications.  Although I did not immediately grasp how intertwined this course of study was with my own, I soon recognized that my academic passion had not changed but become more refined.  The utility of evolutionary theory and population genetics, applied at the level of the meme, seems undeniably useful in a vast array of scientific pursuits.  Although it is often challenged, I believe that we are on the cusp of a major paradigm expansion which will change the way we understand culture and open a myriad of research niches.  This expansion is the proverbial “low-hanging fruit” of my generation and it is immensely thrilling moment to begin my academic career.


* While my long-term career goals are vague and focused around the ideas outlined above, my immediate interests lie in understanding the epidemiological effects of public understanding and misnomers regarding disease prevention.  For example, unfounded fears regarding vaccinations in the United States have the potential to cause outbreaks due to the breakdown of Herd Immunity .  Therefore we would expect that the first outbreaks of this kind would be those with the lowest Herd Immunity Threshold.  Such a common-sense prediction has come to fruition in California with the recent Pertussis outbreak, and threatens to do so with the next likely candidate: Measles.  Questionnaires and data mining of social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, would provide for the generation of ‘meme pools.’  Said pools would form organically around discrete social networks, common personal interests, and/or geographic locations.  Analysis of these data from the evolutionary and population genetics perspectives could prove to be a predictive tool in tracking outbreaks and defining at-risk populations.

Tight Junction Permeability in Sepsis Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

I. SPECIFIC AIMS Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lung specific form of inflammation mediated organ dysfunction that typically follows a severe systemic inflammatory response to an infection or injury. It is characterized by infiltration of proteinaceous fluid and leukocytes into the alveolar air spaces of the lungs and abnormalities of the respiratory surfactant, resulting in impaired gas exchange. Previous literature strongly suggests that this apparent barrier function failure is due to TNF-a mediated degradation of the proteins forming the tight junction structures between alveolar epithelial cells. Unfortunately, traditional anti-TNF-a therapy results in an increased rate of infectious complications, precluding systemic use in the septic population.
The ligand receptor interactions of membrane bound TNF-a, soluble or cleaved TNF-a (sTNF), and its two receptors TNF-R1 (p55) and TNF-R2 (p75) are diverse, flexible, and poorly understood. The predominant theory is that the soluble form of TNF-a is designed to transmit exocrine or paracrine signals to distant cells and that it preferentially interacts with TNF-R1, expressed on all cells, which contains a death domain and mediates apoptosis. On the other hand, the membrane bound form (mTNF) is believed to be designed for juxtacrine signaling between adjacent cells and interacts mainly with TNF-R2 to stimulate transcription of anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory factors. The role of TNF-R2 has received little attention in the literature and is likely underestimated. Several reports verify that sTNFa and TNF-R1 interaction dysregulate tight junctions, but only a few suggest that TNF-R2 might have actions that counteract this dysfunction. Furthermore, the degree of crosstalk and receptor synergy is a point of controversy in the literature.

Aim 1: Using two types of TNF inhibitors (an sTNF inhibitor and an sTNF/mTNF inhibitor) in a mouse mode of sepsis induced acute respiratory distress syndrome, we propose to show that the interaction of mTNF on leukocytes and TNF-R2 on epithelial cells exerts protective effects on tight junction protein expression and organization, preventing the classical features of ARDS pathology.

Aim 2: Using gene knock out animals null for either TNF-R1 or TNF-R2, we will verify that TNF-R2 is required for tight junction maintenance and show that this effect is synergistically amplified in the presence of TNF-R1.

Hypothesis
Dysregulation of the tight junctions between the cells of the lung epithelium can be attenuated via intraalveolar inhibition of TNF-a by means of a synthetic surfactant impregnated with TNF-a inhibitor. Tight junction function can be further improved with the use of an inhibitor selective for sTNFa, where the mTNF/TNF-R2 interaction is maintained, and even further improved when TNF-R2 functions synergistically with TNF-R1. Prevention of tight junction break down and maintenance of barrier function will result in reduced infiltration of fluid, fibrin, albumin, and leukocytes into the alveoli.

70's.  Are they still worth reading?","Like the title says, someone in the bio dept of my school laid out a table full of free books in the hall to clean house.

&gt;""The heterotrophic mode of life is followed not only by animals but by certain groups of plants, the most important being the *fungi*.  These plants lack the green pigment *chlorophyll*, which is otherwise ubiquitous in the vegetable world and plays a central roll in photosynthesis.""

How much else has changed in the realm of botany and ecology since these books were published and they were printed in the 70's?  Enough that it would be a waste of my time to read these or that I'd be reading many now incorrect statements like that?

277,Two Questions. Commensal Bacteria and a gene for immortality.,"Hello /r/biology. I have two questions that I am curious about and I hope that someone can answer.

1)On symbiotic commensal Bacteria.
Where do they exactly arise from and when do they come in to being with the main organism? I assume that they are not included in the gametes otherwise they'll simply be part of the species itself(or are mitochondria of this type?). Or are they inserted during the process of growth( within the embryo with bacteria passed in from the mother or the material is already within the egg.) I am just curious on how this has arisen.

2) Did a gene for immortality ever exist in any species? I mean considering the selfish gene theory there is no reason why this shouldn't exist( or could there be inner competition between genes such as the ones regulating mitosis and death that want to replicate preventing this), considering the high genetic fidelity and a longer life span to reproduce and spread your genes. Although it is definitely unstable evolutionary strategy and would probably die out considering the competitors of this species will end up more adapted in the long run(such as viruses and what not), natural causes will end up harming it, and cancers and DNA mutations will end up piling up. I am curious if such a gene ever existed.

If the organism has homodimer staining bands and heterodimer bands does that always mean the organism is heterozygous at the locus that codes for the polypeptide alleles?

So since all life as we know it has reproductive capabilities and instincts, we can only assume that all the ancestral species had those same capabilities, going way back to the first single celled organism. So then we assume that the first single celled organism formed *with* some sort of cell division mechanism, or else it would not have divided or spawned the organic world we know today. 

I'm not any kind of expert in biology or cell mitosis, but isn't it possible (if not probable) that at some point in history life formed in a similar way to our 'parent cell,' but without a reproductive mechanism? Shouldn't it be very possible that something very similar formed and died without ever reproducing in any way? Or maybe something formed with a reproduction mechanism, but no trigger.  Kind of a dead-end life-form?

It would only be possible to prove the natural formation of life with reproductive capabilities - the proof is in the resulting generations, but it seems like the natural formation of life without reproductive capabilities is much more likely considering the complexities of that function.

I know this is a fruitless exercise, but I am not a biologist but am sure that the following points he has made are provably false. Can you please assist me, O great biologitters?

&gt; There are a number of problems for gene duplication as a source for Darwinian evolution. Some of them I’ve extracted from the article and summarized below: 
 
&gt; Statistical: gene duplication theory predicts that the more genes the more likely that the organism has higher complexity. But rice has twice as many genes as humans, and bacteria more than 3 times as many. Also natural selection selects against gene duplication.

I don't think gene duplication theory predicts this complexity at all, does it? Natural selection wouldn't select against a duplication unless it was detrimental (often not the case), so the paragraph contradicts itself - natural selection would select against rice and bacteria with fewer genes, which it hasn't done.

----

&gt; Evo-devo challenge: A surprisingly small number of genes—“tool kit genes”—are the primary components for building all animals, and these genes emerged before … the Cambrian explosion That means the essential genes have not changed significantly over time, contradicting the central claim of neo-Darwinism. …If this is true, then arguments about gene duplication are irrelevant because ‘evolution’ occurs somewhere else.

I know very little about toolkit genes, but it would seem to me that they aren't an exclusive set of building blocks for all physical traits. I am sure that essential genes have been observed to change experimentally, e.g. as an adaptation to the introduction of a new habitat. Are there any good examples of this?

----
 
&gt; Functional challenge: “evolutionists must assume that multiple mutation events are required to produce a new functional gene, and each of the mutations must not be deleted until the gene has evolved to the degree that positive selection occurs.  Meanwhile however, a duplicated gene may produce either defective proteins that can be toxic or fatal, or, at the least, will tax the cell’s resources and waste amino acids and energy. Because of this, natural selection acts on gene duplications, most often by deleting them from the gene pool”

Duplicated genes can similarly produce beneficial proteins, no?

----
 
&gt; Gene duplication rate: “Because the minimum number of changes necessary for most new gene functions is greater than one altered amino acid, and the number of changes needed in DNA for each altered amino acid varies between one and three… fixation of features requiring changes in multiple residues requires both population sizes and numbers of generations so large that they ‘seem prohibitive’

This is a fairly standard microevolution vs. macroevolution argument, isn't it?

----

&gt; To me, believing that gene duplication as a source for major evolutionary change requires just a bit too much faith. Belief in a supernatural God of course requires faith. But if we were to be honest, belief in Darwinian evolution requires just as much faith, or even more than to believe in a supernatural creator. 
 
I have ""faith"" in the observable, in things that are experimentally tested and peer reviewed, and which have held up to years of scrutiny.

462,I have a genetics question that has been bugging me for a long time about antibodies.,"So my understanding of the immune system must be wrong since it seems to be impossible genetically, so someone please let me know where I am wrong. Alright how I understand antibodies to work is they are specific proteins designed specifically to target a given antigen. So for any antigen the body will detect the antigen, activate a specific cell that produces antibodies for it, and make lots of them.

Even ignoring the complicated issue of how the immune system knows which protein will target that antigen, how can it possibly make a antibody for every antigen?? To produce a protein it has to sequence some of the DNA so I must already have the DNA to build antibodies for every antigen! I am aware there is some issue of mixing the existing code I have in different orders to get different antibodies but that doesn't solve the issue.

Finite amount of DNA (while still a shit ton) means a finite number of sequences means a finite number of possible antibodies.

I see no reason why there should be a finite number of possible 
antigens, so 

**number of possible antigens &gt; number of possible antibodies.**

I was under the impression that for any antigen the body will produce a antibody for it. Why hasn't something attacked us that we can't produce antibodies for?! It seems like that SHOULD exist but I am under the impression it hasn't. If it did wouldn't it be effective at killing us all? (I know our immune response has other defenses but still)

Someone explain how this could possibly work.

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses. Many responded with Recombination, which to me does not answer the question (I should have asked more specifically.) All recombination does is greatly increase the number of possible antibodies produced but it is still a finite number. I believe the total possible antigens should be infinite or at least many orders of magnitude larger than all combinations even with recombinations.

The real answer appears to be that there is not an exact 1 to 1 mapping of antibody to antigen. This allows wiggle room. Makes me think that not everyone will even produce the exact same antibody for every given antigen.

539,Question about how cell membranes evolved.,"I've been trying to better understand evolution, particularly how the first cells came to be.  I know that self-replicating long polymers, possibly strands of RNA, somehow became encased in vesicles made of amphipathic phospholipids.  This is good because it sequesters the relplicator molecules from the outside world, allowing it to exclusively use any catalytic molecules that it produces, and protecting it from potential destruction.  This much makes sense, but I'm having trouble making the leap from replicators enclosed by vesicles to a cell that's capable of producing a phospholipid bilayer.  

Replicator molecules themselves could reproduce because they act as a template for their own duplication.  But how can phospholipids themselves be reproduced?  Where did the phospholipids that make up membranes come from- did they just happen to be present in the prebiotic soup that the replicators were floating around in?  If I'm picturing what happens correctly, wouldn't the replicator molecules have to have a large supply of phospholipid molecules to continue growing and reproducing?  I can't really fathom how there would be a steady supply of ready-to-use phospholipids that just happened to encase the replicator molecules.  I know that modern day cells have enzymes that synthesize phospholipid molecules from precursors that come from food.  But primitive replicators wouldn't have the enzymatic machinery to make their own phospholipids.  I'm assuming it would take a long time for enzymes like this to arise from natural selection.  Does that mean that for a long time, replicator molecules just happened to have a supply of phospholipids, and became automatically enlosed by a phospholipid bilayer because the thermodynamics were favorable?

We have transcribed (using the mMessage mMachine kit from Ambion) RNA from 1.0ug of clean, linearized template and continuously get low yield (~0.5-1.0ug/ul). Our formaldehyde gel (we follow a protocol similar to http://www.protocol-online.org/cgi-bin/prot/view_cache.cgi?ID=3115) shows no presence of Cav3.1 RNA, yet the standard we use is present. Are there any suggestions on handling, storing or transcribing RNA? This stuff seems to degrade if you look at it wrong. I consistently wear gloves and do all of my work in a cell culture room with wonderful hoods.

I screwed up my schooling originally, mainly by choosing degrees that didn't really interest me but I did manage to get pretty much every gen ed. course out of the way.

I took AP biology, genetics, zoology, physics, chemistry, etc.. They were without question my favorite classes, if there was a science class available to take in high school I was all over it. However, it's been 8-12 years ago for some of those classes and I'm most definitely rusty with these subjects.

So then, if what remains of the population survives, stabilises, and begins to grow again from the decreased gene pool, can this be used as an example of the founder effect?
I ask because I've only seen the founder effect used in the context of a small breakaway group from the main population, but in this case, the concept is basically the same, except the original population gone. I was just wondering if the term was still applicable.

Throw an electrode in the solution and you've got AC current. 

My questions/problems are as follows:
-How to get the cells to synchronize? Voltage gated channels? A system where they start out of sync and then all line up over time by some sort feedback?
-If you did get them to all fluctuate at the same time, would the exterior charge or concentration imbalance make it far too difficult for each individual cell to move ions? One possibility I thought of is to have a mixture of cells that use different ion types, but I haven't given much thought as to the effect.",biology,1277620200,Strange_Attractor,6,11,True,2010-06-27

Now I am not a doctor, and can't even begin to pretend I understand everything in those studies. But those studies, taken along with anecdotal evidence on Rick Simpson's video and message board is more than enough evidence to convince me that a cure for cancer does indeed lie in cannabis.
One of the important things about most of these studies is to note that Cannabidiol, not THC, seems to play a HUGE effect in the destruction of cancer cells (apoptosis) and shrinkage of the vessels that supply the tumor with food. The problem is, cannabis that is currently grown for commercial use (even medicinal at the dispensary's) is &lt;1% CBD by volume, measured by gas chromatography. Cannabis that is bred for high THC is generally very low in CBD, while hemp itself that is not used for recreation or medicine is higher in CBD. Smoked marijuana contains nowhere near the amount of THC and CBD that apparently is needed to halt and even shrink tumor growth, more like 1000mg of hash oil, administered daily. For reference, it takes ~5 grams of high quality cannabis to make 1 gram of hash oil.
